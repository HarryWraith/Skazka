      <!-- ===== Overview ===== -->
      <h2 id="overview" class="tb-title">Overview</h2>
      <p>Than, the ancient and enigmatic forest deity of Skazka, is a primal force of nature whose worship predates most
        known religions in the world. Revered almost exclusively within the mysterious woodland realm of Ku’Than, Than
        embodies the untamed spirit of the earth, meting out merciless vengeance on those who defile the sacred Elden
        Wood. Oft depicted as a horned figure with a face that communes through trees, Than’s presence is deeply felt
        rather than widely seen. Her priests and priestesses, known simply as Witches, are nurtured from childhood and
        tested through a brutal rite of survival before earning their place as guardians of the forest. Governed by the
        secretive Council of Than and led by High Witch Serona, the people of Ku’Than live in harmony with nature’s
        harsh order, believing their living forest to be both sanctuary and sentinel — perhaps even a prison to some
        ancient force. Outside their dark and shifting woods, Than’s influence is rare, yet when a Witch emerges, it is
        a sign that something of great consequence stirs within the green heart of Skazka.</p>

    <!-- ===== Influence
 ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="domains">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Influence</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Nature: Central to her worship, Than is deeply tied to the forest, the earth, and the preservation of the
          natural world. Her followers revere untouched wilderness and act as its fierce protectors.</li>
        <li>Vengeance: Than is described as uncompromising and intolerant of those who defile nature. Her Witches
          actively seek retribution against violators, suggesting this as a core aspect of her divine power.</li>
        <li>Mystery or Secrets: The shrouded, ever-shifting forest and the little-known inner workings of Ku’Than point
          to a domain over secrecy, hidden knowledge, or the unknown.</li>
        <li>Fate or Trials: The demanding trials for becoming a Witch, and the idea that not all survive, may hint that
          Than oversees tests of worth, destiny, or the forging of strength through adversity.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Symbols  ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="symbols">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Symbols</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>A Branched Tree with a Face</strong>: Explicitly described as her holy symbol, this image captures
          her communion with followers through the forest itself and reflects her embodiment of the sentient wilderness.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Antlers</strong>: Than is often depicted with antlered horns, symbolizing primal power, wilderness,
          and her kinship with untamed creatures.</li>
        <li><strong>Twisted Vines or Roots</strong>: Representing the deep, binding force of nature and the hidden
          strength beneath the surface, they may also reflect the inescapable reach of her influence.</li>
        <li><strong>The Forest Itself (Elden Wood)</strong>: Not a traditional symbol, but emblematic of her
          essence—living, shifting, ancient, and sacred. Stylized forest motifs or silhouettes might appear in her
          iconography.</li>
        <li><strong>Tree Bark Mask</strong>: Worn by her followers, this might symbolize the merging of identity with
          the forest and Than's spirit.</li>
        <li><strong>Coven Rings or Interlocking Circles</strong>: Representing the sacred bonds between witches and
          their apprentices, and the unity (and fatal link) within her faithful.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Tenets ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="tenets">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Tenets</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Guard the Elden Wood as if it were your own breath—take only what is freely given, and return more than you
          took.</li>
        <li>Let defilers feel the forest’s memory; answer every scar with root, thorn, and silence until balance is
          restored.</li>
        <li>What is hidden is holy—walk the twisting paths, keep the coven’s bonds, and endure every trial the wild
          demands.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Rites & Offerings ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="rites">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Rites</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>At acceptance to Than’s path, a Weird leads a hidden glade-rite: the child is anointed with earth and
          sap—reborn to the forest’s will—meets the woods’ spirits in smoke-born trance, and plants a gifted seed: their
          first pact with Than.</li>
        <li>At maturity, a Witchling undertakes a year and a day alone in Elden Wood—enduring beasts, spirits, and
          hunger to win the forest’s respect. Survival marks Than’s favor; failure means death or, worse, an unnatural
          transformation.</li>
        <li>Than’Dva - In the Sanctuary of Revelations, two newly made Witches enter the sacred pool, bare and
          unadorned, trade their deepest secrets, and receive ancestral blessing. The rite binds their fates—lives
          entwined so tightly that one cannot survive the other’s death.</li>

      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Avatars & Interventions ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="avatars">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Avatars</h2>
      <p>A majestic stag is sometimes seen in fog, leading people to safety or hunters to their doom.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Lore ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="lore">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Lore</h2>
      <p>
        Seroth Hollow, a bold lumber village on the western edge of Elden Wood, ignored the wards of Ku’Than and cut
        into sacred groves. One windless night the forest fell silent; by dawn the village was simply gone. In its place
        yawned a root-choked depression and a single towering tree whose bark bore human faces, mouths parted in terror.
        Witches of Than call it the Tree of Regret: souls bound to bark, forever aware, whispering in familiar voices
        that lure the living. Those who answer return hollow—or not at all.
