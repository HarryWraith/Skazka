            <b>A Branched Tree with a Face</b>: Explicitly described as her holy
            symbol, this image captures her communion with followers through the
            forest itself and reflects her embodiment of the sentient
            wilderness.

          <li>
            <b>Antlers</b>: Than is often depicted with antlered horns,

          <li>
            <b>Twisted Vines or Roots</b>: Representing the deep, binding force

          <li>
            <b>The Forest Itself (Elden Wood)</b>: Not a traditional symbol, but

            <b>Coven Rings or Interlocking Circles</b>: Representing the sacred

        <h2>Than</h2>

        <p>
          Than, the ancient and enigmatic forest deity of Skazka, is a primal
          force of nature whose worship predates most known religions in the
          world. Revered almost exclusively within the mysterious woodland realm
          of Ku’Than, Than embodies the untamed spirit of the earth, meting out
          merciless vengeance on those who defile the sacred Elden Wood. Oft
          depicted as a horned figure with a face that communes through trees,
          Than’s presence is deeply felt rather than widely seen. Her priests
          and priestesses, known simply as Witches, are nurtured from childhood
          and tested through a brutal rite of survival before earning their
          place as guardians of the forest. Governed by the secretive Council of
          Than and led by High Witch Serona, the people of Ku’Than live in
          harmony with nature’s harsh order, believing their living forest to be
          both sanctuary and sentinel — perhaps even a prison to some ancient
          force. Outside their dark and shifting woods, Than’s influence is
          rare, yet when a Witch emerges, it is a sign that something of great
          consequence stirs within the green heart of Skazka.

        <h3>Rites</h3>
        <ul class="nodec">
          <li>
            <b>Rite of the Verdant Covenant (Initiation of Witchlings)</b>: This
            rite begins when a child is accepted into the path of Than. The
            Weird (mentor Witch) performs a secretive ritual at a sacred glade,
            marking the child with earth and sap to symbolize their rebirth into
            the forest’s will. The child is introduced to the spirits of the
            woods, often through dream or trance induced by herbal smoke, and
            given a seed to plant — their first pact with Than.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Trial of Root and Shadow (Coming of Age)</b>
            At the age of maturity, Witchlings undergo a solitary survival
            ordeal: one year and one day alone in the Elden Wood. During this
            time, they must endure its dangers, earn the forest’s respect, and
            avoid becoming prey to both beast and spirit. Survival is seen as
            Than’s personal approval; failure often means death — or worse,
            transformation into something unnatural.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Than'Dva (Witch-Pairing Ritual)</b>: Upon becoming a full Witch,
            the initiate is ritually bound to a covenant-partner in a ceremony
            within a sacred cave known as the Sanctuary of Revelations. The two
            Witches, naked and submerged in the pool, must share their most
            intimate secrets. They are then visited by the spirts of their
            ancestors who bless and sponsor the bonding. Their fates are joined,
            their lives entwined — one cannot survive the other’s death.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>The Vengeance Harvest</b>: When someone defiles the forest, a
            coven may perform this rite under moonlight. Witches gather around a
            tree bearing a face of Than and invoke her fury through chanting,
            blood-letting, and binding effigies made from the violator’s
            discarded items. The rite often precedes a hunt — literal or
            spiritual — in which nature exacts retribution.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Rite of the Twisting Paths (Divination)</b>: This secretive rite
            is used to commune with Than or seek guidance. A Witch enters the
            forest alone, ingesting sacred herbs, and follows an animal or tree
            spirit until a vision is granted. The forest itself becomes the
            altar, the voice, and the veil between worlds.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Burial by the Roots</b>: When a Witch dies, their body is not
            burned or entombed but returned to the forest. They are buried in
            fetal position beneath a young sapling, believed to carry their
            spirit forward. A mask or symbol of their covenant may be hung from
            the branches, marking their passage and presence in the trees.

        <h3>Domains</h3>
        <ul class="nodec">
          <li>
            <b>Nature</b>: Central to her worship, Than is deeply tied to the
            forest, the earth, and the preservation of the natural world. Her
            followers revere untouched wilderness and act as its fierce
            protectors.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Vengeance</b>: Than is described as uncompromising and intolerant
            of those who defile nature. Her Witches actively seek retribution
            against violators, suggesting this as a core aspect of her divine
            power.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Mystery or Secrets</b>: The shrouded, ever-shifting forest and
            the little-known inner workings of Ku’Than point to a domain over
            secrecy, hidden knowledge, or the unknown.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Fate or Trials</b>: The demanding trials for becoming a Witch,
            and the idea that not all survive, may hint that Than oversees tests
            of worth, destiny, or the forging of strength through adversity.

        <h3>lore</h3>
        <ul class="nodec">
          <li>
            Long ago, on the western edge of the Elden Wood, there was a
            thriving lumber village called Seroth Hollow. Nestled dangerously
            close to the border of Ku’Than, its people grew bold with their axes
            and trade, felling ancient trees whispered to be older than the
            gods. Despite warnings etched into bark, the villagers pressed
            deeper into the sacred groves. One night, the forest went silent. No
            wind, no birds, no life. The next morning, Seroth Hollow was gone.
            Not burned, not razed — gone. In its place, a hollow depression in
            the earth stretched like a wound, filled with twisted roots that
            groaned with the sounds of human voices. The only sign of the
            village was a single, towering tree in the center, its bark etched
            with dozens of human faces frozen in expressions of terror. The
            Witches of Than call it The Tree of Regret, and they say each face
            is a soul bound to bark for eternity — not dead, not alive, but
            listening, eternally aware, feeding the tree’s hunger for vengeance.
            To this day, no birds fly above that place, and no creature sets
            foot there. Familiars warn Witchlings never to approach it alone,
            for the tree whispers in the voice of those it has consumed, calling
            for help in familiar tones. Some who answer never return. Others do
            — hollow-eyed, their voices splintered and sap dripping from their
            mouths. It is said that the Tree of Regret is a fragment of Than’s
            wrath made manifest — a punishment not for one crime, but for
            forgetting that the forest is older, crueler, and more sacred than
            man will ever be.
