            <p>Uzume was one of the Three Primals — ancient beings whose wills shaped the foundations of existence. She was
        the
        Lifebringer, the Great Mother, the first spark in the void. From her breath came the Annarr, radiant children of
        divine order and spirit, and from her blood were born the Annarr-kin, faithful companions to the Annarr. In her,
        the
        essence of creation found its genesis; every beating heart, every blooming world traces its origin back to her
        light.
        But her gift of life made her a threat. In time, Uze was betrayed by those she called kin — her brothers, kronos
        and
        Kaos. Kronos, hungry for sole control of time and permanence; Kaos, yearning for unmaking and the return to
        void.
        Together, they struck her down, not with weapons, but with deception, division, and silence. Her fall marked the
        first great wound upon the universe — and from that wound spilled conflict, decay, and the long twilight of
        harmony.
        Yet even in her absence, her touch lingers — in the growing things, in the stars that yet burn, in the souls
        who dare to create rather than destroy. For we are all made of stardust.
