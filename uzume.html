            <img src="assets/uzume.jpg" alt="the goddess uzume" />
            <p>Uzume was one of the Three Primals — ancient beings whose wills shaped the foundations of existence.
                She
                was
                the
                Lifebringer, the Great Mother, the first spark in the void. From her breath came the Annarr, radiant
                children of
                divine order and spirit, and from her blood were born the Annarr-kin, faithful companions to the
                Annarr.
                In her,
                the
                essence of creation found its genesis; every beating heart, every blooming world traces its origin
                back
                to her
                light.
                But her gift of life made her a threat. In time, Uze was betrayed by those she called kin — her
                brothers, kronos
                and
                Kaos. Kronos, hungry for sole control of time and permanence; Kaos, yearning for unmaking and the
                return
                to
                void.
                Together, they struck her down, not with weapons, but with deception, division, and silence. Her
                fall
                marked the
                first great wound upon the universe — and from that wound spilled conflict, decay, and the long
                twilight
                of
                harmony.
                Yet even in her absence, her touch lingers — in the growing things, in the stars that yet burn, in
                the
                souls
                who dare to create rather than destroy. For we are all made of stardust.
