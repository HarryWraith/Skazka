            <h2 id="overview" class="tb-title" style="margin-top:10px">Overview</h2>
            <p>Once a great desert empire in the far south of Skazka, Kaijistan has been a memory for a thousand
                years—its banners dust, its laws forgotten, its cities devoured by dunes. What remains are whispers:
                jeweled towers, buried waterworks, and the lost capital Velkaria, the Diamond of Kaijistan.</p>
            <p>Its descendants wander as fiercely independent tribes, guided by elders whose age grants both authority
                and caution. Outsiders are unwelcome; few are invited to sit by a Kaijistani fire without proving
                themselves beyond doubt. Their violet eyes—said to glow beneath the desert moon—mark the old blood still
                alive in the sands.</p>
            <p>The tribes survive by herding, tracing secret paths between seasonal pastures, ruined cisterns, and
                hidden oases. They scavenge relics of the fallen empire to barter with daring foreigners, though most
                returns are pottery shards and sun-bleached bones. The land remembers, and punishes the greedy.</p>
            <p>The lands of Kaijistan are often called The Forbidden Jewel, a word that conjures both wealth and peril.
                Treasure hunters, relic-seekers, and fortune-chasers regularly brave the endless sands, lured by the
                promise of lost riches from Velkaria and its sister cities. Few return with more than broken pottery and
                sun-bleached bones. Fewer still live to tell of the Sandsea of Zhal’Shaar, the cursed southern wastes
                where supernatural sandstorms rise without warning, swallowing entire caravans and grinding stone to
                powder. Tribal lore warns that the storms are the wrath of the empire itself, punishing those who dare
                seek its hidden diamond.</p>
