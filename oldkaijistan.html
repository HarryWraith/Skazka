            <h2 class="tb-title">Politics</h2>
            <p>There is no state, no crown, no unified banner. The people of Kaijistan now live in small, nomadic
                tribes, each fiercely independent. Governance rests in the hands of elders, men or women whose age
                grants them both authority and caution. Elders rule by consensus, and disputes between tribes are often
                settled through barter, blood-price, or—when tensions boil too hot—sudden violence beneath the stars.
            </p>
            <p>While they have no kings or councils, the tribes share one agreement: outsiders are unwelcome. Foreigners
                are
                treated with suspicion, and few are ever invited to sit by a Kaijistani fire unless they have proven
                themselves beyond doubt.</p>
            <h2 class="tb-title">Population</h2>
            <P>The precise number of Kaijistan’s people is unknown. Tribes are scattered across vast stretches of
                desert, moving constantly between seasonal pastures, ruined cisterns, and secret oases. Some scholars
                suggest that only a few thousand true Kaijistanis remain. The tribes themselves care little for such
                numbers—what matters is survival, and blood ties that reach back to the fallen empire.</P>

            <p>Once a great desert empire in the far south of Skazka, Kaijistan has been nothing more than a memory
                for
                the last thousand years. Its banners have long since turned to dust, its laws forgotten, and its
                cities
                swallowed by the sands. What remains are the whispers of its grandeur—legends of jeweled towers,
                lost
                waterworks, and its fabled capital Velkaria, “the Diamond of Kaijistan.” Though the empire is gone,
                its
                bloodline has not been entirely erased: the scattered descendants of Kaijistani nobility still
                wander
                the dunes, marked by their haunting violet eyes, said to glow faintly beneath the desert moon. These
                desert dwellers live among the ruins, surviving by herding goats, eking sustenance from hidden
                aquifers,
                and scavenging relics of the old world to trade with daring outsiders.

            <h2 class="tb-title">The Ruins of Orishan</h2>
            <p>The half-buried remnants of an ancient city, its toppled minarets said to conceal secret cisterns and
                catacombs where violet-eyed descendants still perform rites in memory of the old gods.</p>
            <h2 class="tb-title">The Glass Dunes</h2>
            <p>A stretch of desert where the sand has been fused into sheets of black glass, as though seared by
                unimaginable fire. Legends speak of a final battle here, where Kaijistan’s sorcerer-kings unleashed
                weapons that scarred the land forever.</p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Visiting Old Kaijistan</h2>
            <p>The lands of Kaijistan are often called The Forbidden Jewel, a word that conjures both wealth and
                peril. Treasure hunters, relic-seekers, and fortune-chasers regularly brave the endless sands, lured
                by
                the promise of lost riches from Velkaria and its sister cities. Few return with more than broken
                pottery
                and sun-bleached bones. Fewer still live to tell of the Sandsea of Zhal’Shaar, the cursed southern
                wastes where supernatural sandstorms rise without warning, swallowing entire caravans and grinding
                stone
                to powder. Tribal lore warns that the storms are the wrath of the empire itself, punishing those who
                dare seek its hidden diamond.</p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">The Aquifers of Kaelir</h2>
            <p>Cavernous underground reservoirs, accessed only by those who know the shifting paths through the
                dunes.
                Said to be haunted by pale, eyeless spirits that guard the water.</p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Velkaria, The Lost Diamond</h2>
            <p>The fabled capital. No one knows its true location, though the tribes whisper that it lies buried
                beneath
                the Sandsea of Zhal’Shaar, waiting for the worthy—or the damned—to find it.</p>
