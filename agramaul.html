      <ul class="nodec">
        <li><b>The scales of truth</b>: A set of perfectly balanced scales that never tip, often depicted wreathed in
          golden light with one pan holding a human heart and the other containing a feather of pure white light. The
          scales represent Agramaul's role as judge, while the heart symbolizes the mortal soul and the feather
          represents absolute truth and moral purity. The scales are said to weigh not just deeds, but the intentions
          behind them.</li>
        <li><b>The Eternal gate</b>: A massive, ornate doorway carved from black stone inlaid with the dying cries of
          mortals, standing open to reveal not darkness but a swirling cosmos of stars and possibilities. The gate
          represents the threshold between life and death, and the runes are said to contain the true names of every
          soul that has ever passed through. The open nature of the gate signifies that death comes to all, while the
          cosmic vista beyond suggests the infinite possibilities of the afterlife.</li>
        <li><b>The All-seeing eye</b>: A single, enormous eye surrounded by concentric rings of smaller eyes, all
          rendered in silver and gold. The central eye blazes with inner light and seems to peer directly into the soul
          of whoever views it. This symbol represents Agramaul's ability to see all truths, past all deceptions, and
          into the very essence of a soul's moral character. The surrounding eyes symbolize the countless perspectives
          and considerations that go into divine judgment.</li>

      <p>Agramaul stands as perhaps the most solemn and impartial of all divine beings, serving as the eternal
        Gatekeeper to the afterlife and the ultimate Judge of Souls who determines the fate of every mortal spirit that
        passes from the realm of the living. Unlike other deities who may be swayed by worship, bribes, or personal
        relationships, Agramaul operates with absolute moral authority and unwavering dedication to cosmic justice,
        weighing each soul against the sum total of their actions, intentions, and the impact they had upon the world
        during their mortal existence. Neither cruel nor merciful in the traditional sense, Agramaul embodies perfect
        justice - a concept that transcends mortal understanding of fairness and operates according to universal
        principles that account for circumstance, intention, capability, and consequence in ways that ensure each soul
        receives exactly what their life's choices have earned them. Standing at the threshold between life and death,
        Agramaul serves not only as judge but also as guardian, ensuring that no soul passes to its final destination
        without proper evaluation, and that the cosmic balance between good and evil, justice and chaos, remains
        eternally maintained. Those who have experienced near-death encounters describe meeting a figure of terrible
        beauty and infinite wisdom, whose very presence strips away all pretense and deception, leaving souls bare
        before the ultimate accounting of their existence.</p>

      <h3 class="skz-viking">Rites</h3>
      <ul class="nodec">
        <li><b>Final confession</b>: A sacred ritual performed for the dying, where a priest of Agramaul helps the
          departing soul make a complete and honest accounting of their life's deeds. The ritual involves burning
          special incense that is said to clear the mind of self-deception and allow the soul to see their actions with
          perfect clarity. The dying person must speak aloud every significant moral choice they remember making, both
          good and evil, while the priest records their words in a sacred tome. This confession is believed to ease the
          soul's passage through judgment, not by granting forgiveness, but by ensuring they face Agramaul with complete
          self-awareness and acceptance of their moral legacy.</li>
        <li><b>The trial of the living</b>: A complex judicial ritual used to determine guilt or innocence in cases
          where mortal justice has failed or where supernatural elements are involved. The accused is brought before an
          altar of Agramaul and must submit to a series of tests designed to reveal their true nature and the extent of
          their guilt or innocence. These tests include walking through flames that burn only the guilty, speaking oaths
          that physically prevent lies, and facing visions of their victims or those they claim to have helped. The
          ritual concludes with divine judgment manifesting as physical signs - guilty parties may find themselves
          marked with visible stigma, while the innocent are blessed with protective auras.</li>
        <li><b>The Weighing of consequences</b>: Performed by communities facing difficult moral decisions with
          far-reaching consequences, this ritual seeks Agramaul's guidance in understanding the full moral implications
          of their choices. Participants must fast for seven days while contemplating their decision, then gather at
          dawn to place symbolic representations of their potential choices on a replica of Agramaul's scales. Through
          meditation, prayer, and sometimes divine vision, participants gain insight into how their decisions might
          affect not just immediate outcomes, but the moral fabric of their community and the souls of all involved. The
          ritual doesn't provide easy answers but grants the wisdom to make informed moral choices.</li>

      <h3 class="skz-viking">Domains</h3>
      <ul class="nodec">
        <li><b>Death</b>: Agramaul governs the transition from life to death and the proper ordering of the afterlife.
          Clerics of this domain can ease the passing of the dying, communicate with souls awaiting judgment, and ensure
          that the dead remain properly dead. They serve as psychopomps, guiding lost souls to their final destination,
          and as guardians against undead abominations that violate the natural order of death.</li>
        <li><b>Justice</b>: As the ultimate arbiter of cosmic justice, Agramaul grants power over truth, judgment, and
          the enforcement of moral law. Clerics can detect lies, compel truthfulness, and deliver divine retribution to
          those who have escaped mortal justice. They excel at solving crimes, exposing corruption, and ensuring that
          the innocent are protected while the guilty face appropriate consequences for their actions.</li>
        <li><b>Knowledge</b>: Agramaul possesses perfect knowledge of every soul's deeds and the wisdom to judge them
          fairly. Clerics of this domain can access memories of the dead, understand the consequences of actions across
          time, and gain insight into the moral implications of complex situations. They serve as counselors,
          historians, and keepers of the moral lessons learned from the lives and deaths of countless souls.</li>

      <h3 class="skz-viking">Lore</h3>
      <ul class="nodec">
        <li>Ancient texts describe how Agramaul was appointed to the role of Judge of Souls after the first mortal death
          created chaos in the cosmic order. Before judgment existed, souls wandered aimlessly between life and death,
          creating havoc in both realms and preventing the natural cycle of existence from functioning properly. The
          other gods, recognizing the need for a final arbiter who could not be corrupted or influenced, elevated
          Agramaul from among their number and granted the power to see into the very essence of souls. The first soul
          judged was said to be that of a great hero who had committed terrible acts in service of good causes, and
          Agramaul's decision established the principle that intentions matter as much as actions, but do not excuse the
          consequences of one's choices.</li>
        <li>Agramaul is said to maintain an infinite ledger that records not just the deeds of every soul, but the
          ripple effects of those deeds throughout time and space. This cosmic book, known as the Akashic Record of
          Moral Consequence, allegedly shows how every choice made by every soul affects the lives of others, the
          balance of good and evil in the world, and the overall spiritual evolution of existence itself. Some scholars
          believe that accessing even a fragment of this ledger would drive mortals mad with the weight of universal
          moral complexity, while others theorize that the ledger is actually woven into the fabric of reality itself,
          making every moment of existence a page in Agramaul's eternal record.</li>
        <li>Eschatological texts speak of a time when Agramaul will close the gates to the afterlife and conduct a
          final, universal judgment of all souls that have ever existed, living and dead alike. This event, known as the
          Great Reckoning, is prophesied to occur when the moral balance of the universe becomes so disrupted that the
          cosmic order itself is threatened. During this final judgment, every soul will be re-evaluated in light of the
          complete moral history of existence, potentially changing their eternal fate based on how their actions
          contributed to or detracted from universal harmony. Some interpretations suggest this will result in a
          restructuring of the afterlife itself, while others believe it will bring about the end of the cycle of life
          and death entirely, ushering in a new phase of existence where souls no longer require judgment because they
          will have achieved perfect moral clarity.</li>
