      <!-- ===== Overview ===== -->
      <h2 id="overview" class="tb-title">Overview</h2>
      <p>Agramaul stands as perhaps the most solemn and impartial of all divine beings, serving as the eternal
        Gatekeeper to the afterlife and the ultimate Judge of Souls who determines the fate of every mortal spirit that
        passes from the realm of the living. Unlike other deities who may be swayed by worship, bribes, or personal
        relationships, Agramaul operates with absolute moral authority and unwavering dedication to cosmic justice,
        weighing each soul against the sum total of their actions, intentions, and the impact they had upon the world
        during their mortal existence. Neither cruel nor merciful in the traditional sense, Agramaul embodies perfect
        justice - a concept that transcends mortal understanding of fairness and operates according to universal
        principles that account for circumstance, intention, capability, and consequence in ways that ensure each soul
        receives exactly what their life's choices have earned them. Standing at the threshold between life and death,
        Agramaul serves not only as judge but also as guardian, ensuring that no soul passes to its final destination
        without proper evaluation, and that the cosmic balance between good and evil, justice and chaos, remains
        eternally maintained. Those who have experienced near-death encounters describe meeting a figure of terrible
        beauty and infinite wisdom, whose very presence strips away all pretense and deception, leaving souls bare
        before the ultimate accounting of their existence.

    <!-- ===== Influence
 ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="domains">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Influence</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Death</strong>: Ease the dying, speak with waiting souls, keep the dead at rest, and bar undeath.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Justice</strong>: Perceive lies, compel truth, expose corruption, and deliver rightful consequence
          while shielding the innocent.</li>
        <li><strong>Knowledge</strong>: Consult the soul-ledger—read the dead’s memories, weigh consequences across
          time, and counsel with clear moral insight.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Symbols  ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="symbols">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Symbols</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Scales of Truth</strong>: Perfectly balanced scales—heart vs. white feather—weighing deed and intent
          in Agramaul’s golden light.</li>
        <li><strong>Eternal Gate</strong>: Black-stone doorway open to a star-swirled cosmos; rune-names of all who
          passed—the threshold of death and its infinite after.</li>
        <li><strong>All-Seeing Eye</strong>: A blazing central eye ringed by many eyes—sight through all deceit to a
          soul’s true moral weight.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Tenets ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="tenets">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Tenets</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Face the Ledger</strong>: Speak truth of deed and intent; accept consequence without plea.</li>
        <li><strong>Honor the Passage</strong>: Guard the boundary of life and death; abhor undeath and exploitative
          necromancy.</li>
        <li><strong>Judge Impartially</strong>: No bribes, no grudges—measure all by the same scale.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Rites & Offerings ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="rites">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Rites</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Final Confession</strong>: For the dying—incense clears self-deceit; the soul speaks every
          remembered choice as a priest records. Not absolution, but clear-eyed reckoning to ease judgment.</li>
        <li><strong>Trial of the Living</strong>: When law fails—stand before Agramaul’s altar: truth-binding oaths,
          guiltless flames, and visions of those harmed/helped. Verdict shows as visible stigma or protective blessing.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Weighing of Consequences</strong>: Before a grave decision—seven-day fast, then place symbols of
          each option on a replica of the Scales. Through prayer and vision, gain moral foresight, not easy answers.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>The Great Reckoning</strong>: When cosmic balance falters, Agramaul closes the Gates and judges every
        soul—living and dead—against the complete moral ledger. Fates may be revised. Aftermath varies by creed: either
        the afterlife is remade or the life–death cycle ends as perfect moral clarity makes judgment unnecessary.
