            <h2 class="tb-title">Overview</h2>

            <p>
                In the wetland-forest expanse surrounding the Blacksong River, a mysterious and ancient tribe has
                emerged—known simply as the Blacksong Goblins. Appearing nearly a millennium ago, their origins are
                whispered in fearful superstition: some say they rose from the river’s black depths, others believe they
                slipped through the fragile Veil between realms. Though no records chronicle their arrival, they swiftly
                established themselves as a warlike and insular people—proud of their isolation and guardians of arcane
                taboos.
            </p>
            <p>
                Driven by a primal need to survive and resection unseen, the Blacksong Goblins are deeply spiritual and
                superstitious. Magic is antithetical to them—regarded as a corrupter of the soul. Their leaders—whether
                revered shamans or fearsome warriors—preach caution, even outright fear, toward sorcery. Instead, they
                place faith in ancestral rites, charms woven from swamp reeds, and the communion with spirits believed
                to inhabit the river’s eddies and fog-laden groves. Their motivations are simple: preserve the purity of
                their tribe, uphold traditions, guard against the corrupting lure of magic, and resection masters of
                their eerie realm.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Blacksong Goblins resection fiercely territorial, rarely forging alliances or mingling with
                outsiders. Tribes cluster along the river’s marshy banks, each governed by a chieftain who is either a
                potent shaman or a legendary warrior. These leaders mediate tribal actions through visions from the
                spirit world or bloody feats of strength.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though they seldom trade goods or share their customs, they sectiontain an uneasy balance with
                neighbouring peoples—through grudging compacts or silent mutual avoidance. Those who trespass risk swift
                retribution. Even so, some outsiders sometimes glimpse them riding through mist, worg companions at
                their side: warg-like beasts trained for hunt and war, fierce partners as much spiritual bonds as tools
                of violence.

            <h2 class="tb-title">Physiology & Traits</h2>
            <p>Blacksong goblins are Small—wiry, whipcord muscle packed into 3–4 feet of quick leverage—built for swamps
                and reed-choked banks. Skin runs mottled olive-gray with a damp sheen; ghost-pale eyes reflect like a
                frog’s at night, giving keen low-light vision but a squint in glare. Ears are big and blade-thin,
                catching the slap of oars or a worg’s breath; noses sort rot from river-fresh in a heartbeat. Long
                forearms, splayed calloused feet, and hooky nails make them sure on mud, roots, and rotting planks, and
                their guts shrug bad water and carrion better than most. In motion they’re all burst and vanish—slipping
                grips, ducking reeds, and melting into shadow—with hands made for traps, knots, and quick theft. In 5e
                terms, think sharp Darkvision, a knack for Disengage/Hide on the move, and ambush grit akin to Fury of
                the Small—physiology and habit tuned to survive where the river swallows the unwary.</p>

        <article class="tb-panel" id="culture">
            <h2 class="tb-title">Culture & Society</h2>
            <p>Blacksong goblins organize by water: reed-villages and raft-clans strung along cutbanks, each ruled by a
                shaman and a clutch of trap-masters. Law is practical—territory, tolls, and taboos—with trespass paid in
                fish, tools, or labor instead of blood if talks hold. They prize cunning over cruelty: woven deadfalls,
                cord snares, signal whistles, and mud-ink marks that read like maps to those who know them. Trade is sly
                but steady—salt fish, reeds, pitch, and swamp cures—bartered for iron scraps, dyes, and needles;
                guest-right on the water is sacred so long as oars stay low and lamps stay hooded.</p>
            <p>Faith is river and ancestor first: offerings sink with the tide, names are rung on shell strings, and
                bright bonfires are taboo (they “call the hungry”). Magic is distrusted; hedge rites and bargains with
                worg totems or bank-spirits are common, but showy sorcery draws arrows. Children learn by mimicry and
                dare—first snare, first night ferry, first reed-mask—and adulthood is claimed with a silent crossing
                past a rival dock. Outsiders see thieves; they see keepers of the margins, wary, cunning, and fiercely
                territorial, surviving by pact and patience where the river eats the unwary.</p>

        <article class="tb-panel" id="faith">
            <h2 class="tb-title">Faith & Myth</h2>
            <p>Blacksong goblin faith is river-first, god-last: they honor the Blacksong itself as a living will, along
                with bank-spirits, fog-wights, and ancestor shades who “ride the current” back to advise the clan. Myths
                tell that, after Starfall, the River drank moonlight and gifted goblins their ghost-pale eyes to see in
                reed-shadow; in return, they swore three taboos—no great bonfires (which “call the hungry”), no metal
                cast into running water, and no oath spoken on a rising flood. Rites are small and practical:
                shell-strings rattled for names, reed masks worn to bargain with worg totems, fish-grease lamps set
                adrift as questions to the current. They distrust showy sorcery, favoring hedge charms and pact-signs;
                good omens are a gull that lands twice, a lamp that returns upstream, or a snag that releases at a
                whispered name.</p>
