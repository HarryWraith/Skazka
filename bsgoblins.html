            <p>Blacksong Goblins are strikingly pale—skin as ghostly as swamp fog—and their eyes glow a vivid, unnerving
                red, like crimson coals against white snow. Their wiry frames lend themselves to stealth and agility,
                but don’t let their lean forms deceive you: in combat, they move with deadly speed and uncanny
                precision. Their contrast—white flesh, red gaze—often unnerves outsiders, reinforcing their reputation
                as spectral hunters born of dark superstition.</p>

            <p>In the wetland-forest expanse surrounding the Blacksong River, a mysterious and ancient tribe has
                emerged—known simply as the Blacksong Goblins. Appearing nearly a millennium ago, their origins are
                whispered in fearful superstition: some say they rose from the river’s black depths, others believe they
                slipped through the fragile Veil between realms. Though no records chronicle their arrival, they swiftly
                established themselves as a warlike and insular people—proud of their isolation and guardians of arcane
                taboos.</p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Heritage</h2>
            <p>They are neither elf nor common goblin: the Blacksong Goblins seemingly sprang into being about 1,000
                years ago. Legends hold that they were formed as a spiritual response to the land’s mourning:
                manifestations of the river’s ancient grief, or spirits trapped between planes drawn into mortal form by
                cosmic disruption.</p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Motivation</h2>
            <p>Driven by a primal need to survive and resection unseen, the Blacksong Goblins are deeply spiritual and
                superstitious. Magic is antithetical to them—regarded as a corrupter of the soul. Their leaders—whether
                revered shamans or fearsome warriors—preach caution, even outright fear, toward sorcery. Instead, they
                place faith in ancestral rites, charms woven from swamp reeds, and the communion with spirits believed
                to inhabit the river’s eddies and fog-laden groves. Their motivations are simple: preserve the purity of
                their tribe, uphold traditions, guard against the corrupting lure of magic, and resection masters of
                their
                eerie realm.</p>

        <div class="tb-panel">
            <h2 class="tb-title">Integration into Society</h2>
            <p>The Blacksong Goblins resection fiercely territorial, rarely forging alliances or mingling with
                outsiders.
                Tribes cluster along the river’s marshy banks, each governed by a chieftain who is either a potent
                shaman or a legendary warrior. These leaders mediate tribal actions through visions from the spirit
                world or bloody feats of strength.</p>

            <p>Though they seldom trade goods or share their customs, they sectiontain an uneasy balance with
                neighbouring
                peoples—through grudging compacts or silent mutual avoidance. Those who trespass risk swift retribution.
                Even so, some outsiders sometimes glimpse them riding through mist, worg companions at their side:
                warg-like beasts trained for hunt and war, fierce partners as much spiritual bonds as tools of violence.
