                        <p>Once the radiant heart of Old Kaijistan’s trade empires and counting-houses, Velkaria is now
                                a buried legend—“death or a diamond, often both.” Tribes whisper it lies somewhere
                                beneath the Sandsea of Zhal’Shaar, near black-glass deserts scorched by the
                                sorcerer-kings’ last weapons, its aquifer roads watched by eyeless spirits.</p>

                        <h3 class="tb-title">Origin, Decline &amp; Current state</h3>
                        <p><strong>Origin</strong>: Velkaria began as the glittering capital of Old Kaijistan, raised by
                                merchant-princes and their sorcerer-king patrons atop the Aquifers of Kaelir, where
                                control of deep water made trade and counting-houses flourish beneath the dunes. Its
                                guilds paved plazas in rune-cut stone and ringed the vaults with oath-wards, while
                                subterranean ledgers and training halls spread under the banking quarter—birthplace of
                                figures like Mortifer, “born beneath the counting-houses of Velkaria.”
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Decline</strong>: Velkaria fell when the demons simply stopped holding back the
                                desert they’d once restrained for the king’s bargain. The winds returned, the dunes
                                marched, and the Sandsea poured through broken passes, choking plazas and
                                counting-houses in silt. Aquifer stairs led only to packed grit and dry wells; cistern
                                vaults collapsed under the weight of drifting stone. Oath-wards didn’t shatter—they were
                                smothered, their sigils buried layer by layer until even their glow could not breathe.
                                Caravans vanished on routes that changed by the hour, and the last survivors walked out
                                under red skies as Velkaria was swallowed whole, lost not to fire or siege but to the
                                patient appetite of the desert.</p>
                        <p><strong>Current state</strong>: Not seen for at least a thousand years. It is impossible to
                                know what state the ruins are in.</p>

                                        rivers” in the dunes that converge at new moon—follow them to the gates.</li>
                                <li>The eyeless spirits of Kaelir drown trespassers without water; only those who return
                                        a stolen relic may pass unfollowed.</li>
                                <li>Rumour: In the cistern depths, an Eyeless Auditor paces by the rattle of abacus
                                        beads on bone; it tallies trespassers like ledgers, and those found “in arrears”
                                        begin coughing dry sand until their lungs balance to zero.</li>

                                <li>The Last Ledger of Velkaria: a calcified account book that tallies truths; when you
                                        speak a claim while touching it, falsehoods bleed as red ink only you can see.
                                        (Said to be from the counting-houses.)</li>
                                <li>Heart of Kaelir: a fist-sized diamond grown around a water-spirit’s tear; once per
                                        day, pour it into a bowl and it becomes pure water for an hour.</li>
                                <li>Seal of the Sorcerer-Kings: a black-glass signet that can “glaze” stone into
                                        temporary armor or fuse doors shut; too much use risks vitrifying the bearer’s

                                <li>Mortifer’s Quiet Knife: an accountant’s slim stiletto engraved with tally marks;
                                        once per long rest, a struck target cannot cry out or make verbal components for
                                        1 round. (Origin story ties to Velkaria’s under-city.)</li>
