            <h2 class="skz-viking">Subclasses in Skazka</h2>
            <p>In the worlds beyond Skazka, classes are rigid paths — the martial discipline of the fighter, the holy
                oaths of the paladin, the timeless teachings of druid and wizard. But in Skazka, where all planes
                converge and shadows bleed into waking life, no path is so narrow.</p>
            <p>The crossroads twists destinies. Warriors are branded by planar scars, priests whisper vows to nameless
                gods, rogues step between veils, and sorcerers wake each morning with a stranger’s voice in their skull.
                The magic of Skazka does not merely grant power — it reshapes the soul, bending tradition into something
                new, something dangerous.</p>
            <p>A Skazkan subclass is not a mere specialization. It is a mark upon the spirit, carved by gods long dead,
                forests that think, or dimensions that hunger. To embrace one is to accept a destiny outside the ordered
                rules of other realms.</p>
            <p>Those who walk these crooked paths find themselves rewoven into the world’s tapestry:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Paladins guard the gates between planes, not just the temples of men.</li>
                <li>Druids root themselves in whispering woods where the trees themselves judge intruders.</li>
                <li>Rogues vanish into twilight rifts that no lantern can pierce.</li>
                <li>Sorcerers and warlocks bargain not only with demons and dragons, but with the echoes of forgotten
                    ages.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To take a subclass in Skazka is to declare allegiance to the crossroads itself. You are no longer merely
                adventurers — you are anomalies, the chosen and the cursed, carrying pieces of realms that should never
                meet.</p>
            <p>And when you level, when your blood burns with new power, remember: in Skazka, it is never without cost.
                Every oath sworn, every spirit bound, every shadow mastered leaves a scar.</p>

            <h2 class="skz-viking" id="barbarian_sc">Barbarian: Path of the Shadow-Weaver</h2><br><br>
            <div class="tb-panel">
                <p>In the half-light of Skazka, rage is not just fury but unraveling. Those who walk the Path of the
                    Shadow-Weaver draw the darkness into themselves, letting their wrath take shape as living shadow.
                    They
                    are half-seen, half-felt — warriors who blur at the edges, their fury whispered by the abyss.</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <h2 class="tb-title">Shadow’s Veil</h2>
            <p>
                Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, dim light and darkness embrace you while you rage.
                While
                raging, you can attempt to hide even when only lightly obscured by shadows, and creatures have
                disadvantage
                on opportunity attacks against you if you start your turn in dim light or darkness.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Umbral Aura</h2>
            <p>
                Also at 3rd level, when you begin your rage, shadows coil around you. While you are raging and in dim
                light
                or darkness, each creature of your choice that starts its turn within 5 feet of you takes psychic damage
                equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1).
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Umbral Step</h2>
            <p>
                At 6th level, you can step between shadows. As a bonus action while raging, you can teleport up to 30
                feet
                to an unoccupied space you can see that is in dim light or darkness. You can use this feature a number
                of
                times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all uses when you finish a long rest.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Creeping Dread</h2>
            <p>
                Beginning at 10th level, your attacks spread fear. Once per turn when you hit a creature with a melee
                weapon
                attack while raging, you can force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency
                bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the start of your
                next
                turn.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Shadowborne Fury</h2>
            <p>
                At 14th level, you can briefly become a creature of pure shadow. Once per rage, you can become
                incorporeal
                until the start of your next turn. While incorporeal, you have resistance to all damage except force,
                psychic, and radiant, and you can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain.
                If
                you end your turn inside an object, you are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and take 1d10 force
                damage.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Tenets of the Crossroads</h2>
            <div class="tb-panel">
                <p>Most paladins swear to gods or crowns; these swear to the roads between. Bound by an Oath of the
                    Crossroads, they guard the thresholds where one world touches another. They are gatekeepers and
                    judges,
                    drawing strength from the law of passage itself — that none may trespass unchallenged.</p>
                <p>Paladins who swear this oath are bound to guard the thresholds between realms. Their tenets vary, but
                    all
                    share themes of vigilance, judgment, and balance.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Guard the Threshold. Protect the boundaries between worlds.</li>
                    <li>Judge the Intruder. No trespass goes unchallenged.</li>
                    <li>Hold the Balance. Do not allow one realm to overrun another.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <br>
            <h2 class="tb-title">Channel Divinity</h2>
            <p> When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Seal the Threshold</strong>. As an action, you present your holy symbol and call upon planar
                    seals. For 1 minute, creatures within 30 feet of you cannot teleport or travel between planes
                    against their will unless they succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC.</li>
                <li><strong>Banishing Smite</strong>. When you hit a creature with your Divine Smite, you can use your
                    Channel Divinity to force it to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it is banished to a
                    harmless demiplane until the end of your next turn.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Aura of the gate</h2>
            <p>
                Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have advantage on saving throws
                against effects that would teleport or forcibly move you to another plane. At 18th level, the range of
                this aura increases to 30 feet.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Crossroads judgment</h2>
            <p>
                At 15th level, you can see the truth of intruders. As an action, choose one creature you can see within
                30 feet. You immediately learn its plane of origin, whether it is under a curse, and whether it is
                disguised or shapeshifted. Additionally, you gain advantage on your next attack roll or spell against
                that creature within the next minute. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish
                a short or long rest.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">The Last Gatekeeper</h2>
            <p>
                At 20th level, you can assume the mantle of the eternal guardian. When you are reduced to 0 hit points,
                you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. You immediately teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied
                space you can see, and you gain temporary hit points equal to twice your paladin level. Once you use
                this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

            <div class="tb-panel">
                <p>In Skazka, the forests remember. The druids of the Whispering Wood are their voices. They murmur with
                    the roots, learn from the sap, and wield the judgment of ancient trees whose memory is older than
                    kings. To them, growth is never gentle — it strangles as easily as it shelters.</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <h2 class="tb-title">Murmur of Leaves</h2>
            <p> When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you can communicate with plants as if under the effect of
                speak with plants, though the plants’ awareness is limited. In addition, when you spend at least 10
                minutes in a wooded area, you gain advantage on checks to track creatures or navigate terrain within
                that forest.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Warding Thorns</h2>
            <p>
                Starting at 6th level, while you are in Wild Shape, your form sprouts spectral thorns. When a creature
                hits you or an ally within 10 feet of you with a melee attack, it takes piercing damage equal to your
                Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Entangling Echoes</h2>
            <p>
                At 10th level, you can call forth vines of memory. As an action, you can force all creatures of your
                choice within 30 feet to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a
                creature’s speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn. You can use this feature once per
                short or long rest.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Verdant Requiem</h2>
            <p>
                At 14th level, once per long rest, you can unleash the full judgment of the forest. As an action, you
                conjure a burst of spectral vines in a 30-foot radius centered on yourself. Each enemy in that area must

            <h2 class="skz-viking" id="sorc_sc">Sorcerer: Soulbind Origin</h2><br><br>
            <div class="tb-panel">
                <p>Not all sorcerers are born with wild blood or draconic veins. In Skazka, some are bound — soul to
                    spirit, past to present. These Soulbound carry fragments of guardians, demons, or dream-echoes
                    within them. Their power is never entirely theirs; it whispers, shields, hungers, and always
                    demands.</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <h2 class="tb-title">Ancestral Echo</h2>
            <p> At 1st level, you are bound to a lingering spirit. Choose an affinity: Frost, Dream, or Shadow. You gain
                a minor benefit associated with that affinity, such as resistance to cold damage, advantage on saving
                throws against being charmed, or darkvision out to 60 feet.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Spirit Surge</h2>
            <p>
                At 6th level, when you cast a spell associated with your spirit’s theme, you can add your Charisma
                modifier to one damage roll or extend the spell’s duration by 1 round. You can use this feature a number
                of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses on a long rest.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Shared Burden</h2>
            <p>
                At 10th level, your spirit protects you from death. When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can drop
                to 1 hit point instead. You then take necrotic damage equal to your sorcerer level at the start of your
                next turn. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Ascendant Binding</h2>
            <p>
                At 14th level, you can manifest your spirit in a spectral avatar. As an action, you summon it for 1
                minute. It takes the form of a Large incorporeal ally within 10 feet, grants you advantage on saving
                throws against spells, and once on each of your turns, when you cast a spell, you can deal additional
                damage equal to your Charisma modifier to one target of that spell. Once you use this feature, you can’t
                use it again until you finish a long rest.

                <p>The Veilstride move where light cannot follow. In alleys, ruins, and shadowed crossings, they slip
                    through dimness as if between worlds. Their daggers strike from impossible angles, their presence
                    vanishes with the turning of a head. They are spies of twilight, assassins of the unseen paths.

            <h2 class="tb-title">Veilstep</h2>
            <p> At 3rd level, when you take the Hide action while in dim light or darkness, you can teleport up to 30
                feet to another unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. You can use this
                feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Ghost's Ambush</h2>
            <p>
                Also at 3rd level, if you attack from hiding in dim light or darkness, the target has disadvantage on
                the next saving throw it makes against your abilities before the end of your next turn.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Shadow Slip</h2>
            <p>
                At 6th level, when you take the Dodge action while in dim light or darkness, you also become partially
                incorporeal until the start of your next turn. During this time, you can move through creatures’ spaces
                (not walls), and opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage. You cannot be harmed by
                non-magical attacks.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Master of Shadows</h2>
            <p>
                At 10th level, when you are in dim light or darkness, you are invisible to creatures relying on sight to
                perceive you until you attack, cast a spell, or move more than half your speed.
            </p>
            <h2 class="tb-title">Pull of the rift</h2>
            <p>
                At 14th level, your Sneak Attack tears at planar fabric. Once per turn when you deal Sneak Attack
                damage, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your
                Dexterity modifier) or be stunned until the start of your next turn. Once a creature succeeds on this
                save, it is immune for 24 hours.

            <div class="tb-panel">
                <p>The wizards of the Fading Echo study not what is, but what is left behind. They weave magic from
                    half-memories, from afterimages that linger when a spell is gone. Their art is ephemeral and
                    haunting: illusions that echo themselves, hands that grasp from beyond, and storms that tear through
                    the fabric of both matter and memory.
                </p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <h2 class="tb-title">Echoed Spells</h2>
            <p> Starting at 2nd level, when you cast a 1st-level or higher wizard spell, you can choose to echo it. The
                spell lingers faintly in the Ethereal Plane for 1 minute. Once during that time, you or an ally within
                30 feet can trigger the echo as a bonus action, replicating the spell’s effect centered on its original
                target. Does not work on area of effect spells. You can use this feature once per long rest. At 10th
                level,
                you can use it twice.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Spectral Ward</h2>
            <p>
                At 6th level, you can weave defensive echoes. As a reaction when a creature within 30 feet is targeted
                by a ranged attack, you can grant that creature +2 AC until the start of its next turn. You can use this
                feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Phantom Grasp</h2>
            <p>
                At 10th level, your mage hand can pass through solid objects and can attempt to grapple creatures within
                30 feet (Strength check using your spell save DC).
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Temporal Slip</h2>
            <p>
                At 14th level, when you fail a saving throw against a spell or magical effect, you can reroll it and
                must take the new result. You can use this feature once per long rest.
            </p>
            <h2 class="tb-title">Ethereal Storm</h2>
            <p>
                At 18th level, you can unleash a storm of echoing power. As an action, choose a point within 60 feet.
                All creatures of your choice within a 20-foot radius must make a Constitution saving throw against your
                spell save DC. On a failed save, they take 8d8 force damage and are pushed 20 feet away from the point
                of origin; on a success, they take half damage. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
                you finish a long rest.

            <div class="tb-panel">
                <p>
                    A strike is not one moment, but many. Monks of the Echoing Fist channel Skazka’s fractured memories
                    into their bodies,
                    leaving aftershocks of every movement. Each punch ripples across time; each palm carries erasure. In
                    their silence,
                    the past and present collapse into one relentless flow.
                </p>
            </div>
            <br>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Echo Strike</h2>
            <p>
                Starting at 3rd level, when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 ki point to
                create an <em>echo</em>
                of that motion. On your next turn, before the end of your turn, you can repeat that strike against the
                same target as a
                free action: make the same attack roll again against that target. On a hit, the attack deals the normal
                damage for your
                unarmed strike (no additional modifiers beyond those that would normally apply). You can create only one
                echo at a time.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Memory Palm</h2>
            <p>
                Also at 3rd level, when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can blur a sliver of its
                short-term memory. The
                target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom
                modifier) or lose its
                reaction until the start of your next turn. You can use Memory Palm a number of times equal to your
                proficiency bonus,
                and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Recalled Motion</h2>
            <p>
                At 6th level, you can retrace the perfect line of a moment. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 ki point
                to instantly move
                to the space you occupied at the end of your previous turn (if it is unoccupied), without provoking
                opportunity attacks.
                If that space is occupied or invalid, this feature has no effect but the ki point is not expended.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Memory Erasure</h2>
            <p>
                At 11th level, when you hit the same creature with three separate unarmed strikes on your turn, you can
                spend 3 ki points
                to force it to make an Intelligence saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom
                modifier). On a failure,
                the creature forgets your presence until the end of your next turn: it can’t target you with attacks or
                spells and treats
                you as invisible (though area effects still affect you). The effect ends early if you deal damage to it

            <p>
                At 17th level, you can split a single motion into many. When you take the Attack action on your turn,
                you can spend
                5 ki points to duplicate one unarmed strike you make with <em>echoes</em> that lash out at nearby foes.
                Choose one
                unarmed strike you’ve made as part of that Attack action; apply its attack roll against every creature
                of your choice
                within 10 feet of you (roll damage separately for each creature hit). You can’t apply Stunning Strike or
                similar effects
                to more than one creature with this feature.

                <p>
                    Some still call on Uzume, the murdered Vekya whose blood seeded the world. Her champions take the
                    field as living
                    relics—warriors whose blows carry renewal and whose presence wards against decay. To fight beside
                    them is to feel
                    life push back against the void.
                </p>
            </div>
            <br>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Mother’s Blessing</h2>
            <p>
                Starting at 3rd level, Uzume’s echo rides your strikes. Once per turn when you hit a creature with a
                weapon attack,
                you can restore hit points to one ally (other than you) within 10 feet of you equal to your Constitution
                modifier
                (minimum of 1). A creature can’t benefit from this feature more than once per turn.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Vital Strikes</h2>
            <p>
                Also at 3rd level, your weapon attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and
                immunity to
                nonmagical attacks and damage.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Blooming Resilience</h2>
            <p>
                At 7th level, whenever you or an ally within 10 feet of you regains hit points, that creature also gains
                temporary
                hit points equal to your proficiency bonus. A creature can gain these temporary hit points from this
                feature only
                once per turn.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Shelter of Life</h2>
            <p>
                At 10th level, when a creature you can see within 15 feet of you would be reduced to 0 hit points, you
                can use your
                reaction to cause it to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again
                until you
                finish a short or long rest.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Wellspring of Creation</h2>
            <p>
                At 15th level, when you use your Second Wind, each ally of your choice within 20 feet of you also
                regains hit points
                equal to your fighter level.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Avatar of Uzume</h2>
            <p>
                At 18th level, you can manifest the Lifebringer’s grace. As a bonus action, you enter this state for 1
                minute:
                your weapon attacks heal an ally within 10 feet of the target for an amount equal to half the damage
                dealt
                (rounded down), and you shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for 20 feet beyond. Once you
                use this
                feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

                <p>
                    As Skazka’s forests fade and beasts slip from memory, the Huntsmen take up their calling. They stalk
                    what leaves no tracks,
                    listen to woods that try to forget, and walk beside spirits of leaf and shadow. Where others lose
                    the path, the Huntsman
                    becomes it.
                </p>

            <br>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Shadowed Quarry</h2>
            <p>
                Starting at 3rd level, when you mark a creature with <em>hunter’s mark</em> (or your Favored Foe), you
                glimpse the
                wild’s hidden truths. You learn whether the target is undead, construct, or extraplanar, and whether it
                is under a curse
                or memory-altering magic. While the mark persists, you have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to
                track that creature
                and on Intelligence (Investigation) checks made to interpret its spoor or signs. In addition, nonmagical
                difficult terrain
                does not slow your group while you are tracking your marked quarry.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Fading Step</h2>
            <p>
                At 7th level, the wilds teach you to vanish between heartbeats. As a bonus action while you are in
                natural terrain,
                you become invisible until the start of your next turn or until you attack, cast a spell, or leave that
                terrain.
                You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended
                uses when
                you finish a long rest.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Spirit Companion</h2>
            <p>
                At 11th level, you call a beast-spirit of leaf and shadow to hunt by your side. As an action, you summon
                a
                spectral companion that manifests in an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet and lasts for 1
                hour,
                until it is reduced to 0 hit points, or until you dismiss it (no action required). The companion uses
                the
                <em>wolf</em> stat block, except it is a Fey, has darkvision 60 ft., and can move through the space of
                other
                creatures as if it were difficult terrain (but not through solid objects). It is resistant to nonmagical
                bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. The companion acts on your initiative, obeys your verbal
                commands,
                and if you issue none, it takes the Dodge action. Once you summon the companion, you can’t do so again
                until
                you finish a long rest, or you can expend a 2nd-level spell slot to summon it again.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Hunt the Forgotten</h2>
            <p>
                At 15th level, your strikes punish things that memory can’t hold. Once on each of your turns when you
                hit a creature
                with a weapon attack, you deal an extra 2d8 psychic damage if the target is immune to being charmed or
                frightened,
                or if it is an undead or construct. A creature can’t take this extra damage from you more than once per
                turn.

                    Not every song is meant to endure. Bards of the Fading Song weave laments that unravel memory and
                    hush the proud.
                    Their voices summon choirs of the forgotten, gnawing at the edges of thought. To hear them is to
                    feel beauty fade—
                    and to know that nothing lasts.
                </p>
            </div>
            <br>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Song of Silence</h2>
            <p>
                Starting at 3rd level, you can spend a use of your Bardic Inspiration as a bonus action to loose a note
                that eats sound.
                A 10-foot-radius sphere of magical hush centers on you until the start of your next turn. Within the
                area, verbal
                components can’t be uttered and creatures are deafened. Creatures and objects can still be targeted
                normally outside
                of the normal <em>silence</em> spell’s total sound negation—this is a brief, choking hush, not an
                environmental seal.
                If you move, the sphere moves with you. You can’t use this feature if you are unable to speak or produce
                sound.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Erasure Inspiration</h2>
            <p>
                Also at 3rd level, when a creature uses your Bardic Inspiration die on an ability check, attack roll, or
                saving throw,
                it can choose to end one of the following conditions affecting it: <em>charmed, frightened, grappled,
                    restrained,
                    deafened</em>. The condition ends immediately after the die is rolled. A creature can benefit from
                this erasure only
                once per short or long rest.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Dissonant Echo</h2>
            <p>
                At 6th level, your fading refrain lingers as a psychic burr. When a creature you can see within 60 feet
                expends a Bardic
                Inspiration die you granted, choose one enemy you can see within 60 feet that can hear you. That enemy
                must succeed on a
                Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or take psychic damage equal to one roll of your Bardic
                Inspiration die
                and has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn. You can trigger
                this feature a
                number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when
                you finish a
                long rest.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Final Verse</h2>
            <p>
                At 14th level, you learn the song that outlives the singer. Once per long rest, when you drop to 0 hit
                points or when
                you take an action on your turn, you can begin the Final Verse, creating a 30-foot aura of resonant
                memory for 1 minute.
                While in the aura, allies of your choice gain advantage on saving throws against being <em>charmed</em>
                or
                <em>frightened</em>, and once during the duration each affected ally can roll your Bardic Inspiration
                die and add the
                number rolled to one attack roll or saving throw (this doesn’t expend your Bardic Inspiration). The song
                persists even
                if you fall unconscious, but it ends early if you die.

            <div class="tb-panel">
                <p>
                    Clerics of the Ancient Mother tend the last green spark of Uzume, the murdered Lifebringer. Their
                    prayers coax
                    sap to rise and memory to return; their wrath chokes rot and gnaws at entropy. To walk with them is
                    to feel the
                    world insist on living.
                </p>
            </div>
            <br>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Bonus Proficiencies</h2>
            <p>
                When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency in <em>Nature</em> and with the herbalism
                kit.
                You also learn the <em>druidcraft</em> cantrip if you don’t already know it.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Gift of Renewal</h2>
            <p>
                Also at 1st level, Uzume’s remnant answers your healing magic. When you cast a spell of 1st level or
                higher that
                restores hit points to a creature, you can choose one of the following additional effects on that
                target:
                end one disease; end the <em>poisoned</em>, <em>frightened</em>, or <em>charmed</em> condition; or end
                one
                magical effect that specifically alters or erases the creature’s memories (DM’s discretion). You can use
                this
                feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended
                uses when
                you finish a long rest.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Channel Divinity: Restore Memory</h2>
            <p>
                Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to knit torn recollection. As an action, you
                touch a
                willing creature and restore a single memory that was altered, erased, or blocked by magic within the
                last 24 hours
                (as if ending the effect of a <em>modify memory</em> spell for that incident). If the memory loss
                predates the last
                24 hours, the creature instead recalls one clear fragment or image related to the lost memory (DM’s
                discretion).
                This does not reveal information the creature never possessed.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Aura of Growth</h2>
            <p>
                At 6th level, life gathers around you. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you who start their
                turns at
                half their hit point maximum or fewer regain hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). A
                creature
                can benefit from this aura only once per turn. At 17th level, the radius of this aura increases to 30
                feet.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Divine Strike</h2>
            <p>
                At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with vital radiance. Once on each of
                your turns
                when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant
                damage. When
                you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Mother’s Rebirth</h2>
            <p>
                At 17th level, you can turn the moment of loss into life. When a creature you can see within 30 feet
                would be
                reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to have it drop to 1 hit point instead. When you do,
                you can
                also end one of the following conditions on that creature: <em>blinded</em>, <em>deafened</em>,
                <em>paralyzed</em>,
                or <em>poisoned</em>. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

                <p>
                    Some supplicate to gods or fiends; others bind themselves to absence itself. Those who swear to the
                    shadow of
                    Fafnirog — the Void Dragon who feasts on light and memory — learn to exhale silence, drink secrets,
                    and wear
                    wings of nothingness. Their magic does not blaze; it erases.
                </p>
            </div>
            <br>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Void Breath</h2>
            <p>
                Starting at 1st level, you can exhale a gout of un-light. As an action, you unleash a 15-foot cone of
                void. Each
                creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC, taking
                <strong>1d6 force
                    damage</strong> on a failed save, or half as much on a success. Nonmagical
                light sources in
                the cone are snuffed out. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus,
                and you
                regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
                <br><br>
                The damage increases to <strong>2d6</strong> at 3rd level, <strong>3d6</strong> at 5th level, and
                <strong>4d6</strong> at 7th level.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Entropic Resistance</h2>
            <p>
                Also at 1st level, you harden your flesh against the void. Choose <em>necrotic</em> or <em>psychic</em>
                damage.
                You gain resistance to the chosen type. You can change this choice whenever you finish a long rest.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Silence of Fafnirog</h2>
            <p>
                At 6th level, the void answers your call. You can cast <em>silence</em> centered on a point you can see
                within
                60 feet without expending a spell slot or material components. When cast this way, the spell’s duration
                is
                concentration, up to 1 minute, and the sphere is visibly rimmed by a thin ring of black-violet embers.
                You can
                use this feature once per short or long rest.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Memory Devourer</h2>
            <p>
                At 10th level, when a creature you can see within 30 feet drops to 0 hit points, you can use your
                reaction to
                siphon its fading thoughts. You gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock
                level,
                and the next time you make an ability check or saving throw before the end of your next turn, you do so
                with
                advantage. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain
                all expended
                uses when you finish a long rest.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Wings of the Void</h2>
            <p>
                At 14th level, you unfurl wings of living shadow. As a bonus action, you gain a flying speed of 60 feet
                and
                immunity to the <em>frightened</em> condition for 1 minute. While this feature is active, dim light
                within 10 feet
                of you is considered darkness. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long
                rest.

                    The Primal Scourge bleed not only to harm, but to seed. Their rites mingle hemocraft with the last
                    green spark of
                    Uzume, turning pain into plenty and wielding life as a weapon against rot and void. Where they
                    strike, wounds bloom;
                    where they stand, allies rise again.
                </p>
            </div>
            <br>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Rite of the Primals</h2>
            <p>
                When you choose this order at 3rd level, you learn the <strong>Crimson Rite of the Primals</strong>.
                When you activate your Crimson Rite, you can choose this rite to infuse your weapon strikes with radiant
                vigor.
                While this rite is active, your rite damage type is <strong>radiant</strong> instead of the chosen type,
                and
                <em>once on each of your turns</em> when you deal your Crimson Rite damage to a creature, you can cause
                one ally
                (other than you) within 10 feet of the target to regain hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier
                (minimum of 1). A creature can benefit from this healing only once per turn.
                This feature otherwise follows all normal rules for Crimson Rite.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Primal Litany</h2>
            <p>
                Also at 3rd level, you learn druidic fragments that steady the hand that bleeds.
                You gain proficiency in the <em>Nature</em> skill or <em>Herbalism Kit</em> (your choice). In addition,
                when you
                finish a short rest, you can choose yourself or one creature you touch; until the start of your next
                turn, the
                chosen creature has advantage on the next death saving throw it makes.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Lifeblood Transference</h2>
            <p>
                At 7th level, you can turn your suffering into a bulwark. Whenever you take hemocraft damage from
                activating a
                Crimson Rite or from amplifying a Blood Curse, you can choose to take an additional <strong>1d6</strong>
                hemocraft
                damage. If you do, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet; it gains temporary hit points equal
                to the total
                hemocraft damage you took from that activation or amplification. You can use this feature a number of
                times equal to
                your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Scourging Aura</h2>
            <p>
                Beginning at 11th level, while your Crimson Rite is active, you exude a faint, pollen-like radiance that
                unsettles
                the faithless and the hollow. Creatures of your choice that start their turn within 10 feet of you have
                <strong>disadvantage</strong> on saving throws against being <em>charmed</em> or <em>frightened</em>
                until the start
                of their next turn. In addition, creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against your <em>Blood
                    Curses</em>
                while they are within 10 feet of you. A creature that succeeds on a saving throw against one of your
                Blood Curses
                is immune to this secondary disadvantage from your aura until the end of its next turn.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Avatar of Blood and Seed</h2>
            <p>
                At 15th level, you can erupt with the Lifebringer’s echo. As a bonus action while your Crimson Rite is
                active, you
                can assume the avatar for 1 minute. For the duration:
            </p>
            <ul class="skz-ul">
                <li>Your weapon attacks deal an extra <strong>1d8 radiant</strong> damage.</li>
                <li>Allies of your choice that start their turn within 20 feet of you gain <strong>1d6</strong>
                    temporary hit points.</li>
                <li>When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you can immediately choose one ally within 20
                    feet to regain
                    hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). A creature can benefit from this
                    healing only once per round.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
