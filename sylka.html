      <p>Once, she was a shadow among shadows, a mortal thief whose fingers stole coin and whispers with equal ease. One
        night, chasing a secret rumored to unmake kings, she found herself at the edge of a forgotten temple, where a
        dying god murmured riddles of power and oblivion. Desperate, she offered him her life in exchange for mastery
        over the unseen, and he laughed—knowing death alone could not bind her cunning. When she claimed his final
        breath, the world fractured beneath her will, and the shadows she had once walked through began to bend and
        whisper to her. In that fracture, mortals no longer bound her; she became the goddess of secrets and thievery,
        the patron of those who move unseen, her eyes always gleaming with the thrill of stolen truths.</p>

        <li><b>Whispered pact</b>: a vow of silence spoken in a hidden place, sealed by the sharing of a personal secret
          with the goddess.</li>
        <li><b>Shadow marking</b>: a ceremonial tattoo of her serpent-dagger symbol, inked under the moon, to mark a
          devotee as her chosen agent in the mortal world.</li>

        <li>It is said that the first coin she ever stole as a mortal glimmered with divine fire—an omen that she was
          destined to take more than mere gold.</li>
        <li>Legends whisper that she sometimes appears as a beggar or masked merchant, quietly tipping the scales of
          fate for rogues and kings alike.</li>
        <li>Those who betray her secrets or misuse the knowledge she grants often vanish into shadows, never to be seen
          again, their stories only whispered in fear.</li>
