      <p>Once, she was a shadow among shadows, a mortal thief whose fingers stole coin and whispers with equal ease.
        One
        night, chasing a secret rumored to unmake kings, she found herself at the edge of a forgotten temple, where a
        dying god murmured riddles of power and oblivion. Desperate, she offered him her life in exchange for mastery
        over the unseen, and he laughed—knowing death alone could not bind her cunning. When she claimed his final
        breath, the world fractured beneath her will, and the shadows she had once walked through began to bend and
        whisper to her. In that fracture, mortals no longer bound her; she became the goddess of secrets and thievery,
        the patron of those who move unseen, her eyes always gleaming with the thrill of stolen truths.</p>

          seen
          again, their stories only whispered in fear.</li>
