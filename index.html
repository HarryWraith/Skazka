                <h2>Welcome to Skazka</h2>
                <p>
                    Skazka is a world shaped by forgotten myths, ruthless gods, and ancient magic. From haunted necropolises to
                    whispering
                    jungles, Skazka is a place where every shadow holds a story, and every path promises mystery, danger, and
                    transformation.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    At its core, Skazka is a living narrative: immersive, richly textured, and deeply atmospheric. The world
                    blends
                    Slavic, Norse, and original mythologies into something new—something strange, lyrical, and menacing. The
                    name
                    itself, "Skazka," is derived from the Russian word for "fairy tale," but the tales here are anything but
                    comforting.
                    Instead, they are blood-soaked, ironic, and often tragic, where happy endings are hard-won — if they come at
                    all.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    Players and readers enter Skazka through the eyes of complex characters — like the Thief, darting through
                    city alleys in
                    search of survival; the Witchling, bartering with spirits in the deep, enchanted woodlands; or the Warlord,
                    weighed
                    down by duty, standing before the bones of the dead. These individuals inhabit a world full of lore:
                    sentient forests,
                    cursed relics, crumbling empires, and gods that walk the earth.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    But Skazka is not only a setting — it’s a tone, a philosophy of storytelling. It asks you to embrace
                    ambiguity, to
                    question what’s real, and to find beauty in the strange and the broken. It rewards those who pay attention
                    to detail
                    and aren't afraid to dive into morally gray choices.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    Whether you're here to read its tales, play within its systems, or build your own stories in its shadowy
                    corners,
                    Skazka invites you in with a warning: in this world, magic has a price, and not every monster looks like
                    one.
                </p>
        
                <p>Dare to enter. Skazka awaits.</p>

            <h2>The Warlord</h2>
            <p>A lone adventurer steps off the longboat that has taken him to the necropolis of Dargav. The aging jetty
                creaks underfoot and the forest seems to mimic the sound. A crow lands on a nearby branch to judge the
                visitor. It caws, perhaps in approval? Clutching the urn he has brought here, the warrior takes a deep
                breath and steps forward. This place is hallowed so he must tread carefully.</p>

            <h2>The Thief</h2>
            <p>Back where the soldier began his journey, the streets of Calarium are choked with the dust from passing
                horses and carts. A small child weaves through a crowd of merchants and soft skinned gentry. Spotting
                her mark, she approaches confidently. With practiced ease she feigns a trip and bumps into the
                unsuspecting gem cutter. With an apology she pushes away from the man, but not empty handed. The
                concealed blade in one hand has liberated a purse of its strings. Stepping casually away from the crowd
                she slips into a darkened alleyway to assess her work. Only five gold coins. Not bad, but not enough to
                get her to Ku'Than. That will have to wait, for now.</p>           
        </article>

            <img src="assets/kuthan_intro.jpg" alt="image of a young witch with a fairy in a bottle">
            <h2>The Witchling</h2>
            <p>Far to the north and  east the beggar's sister stifles in the humidity of Ku'Than's forested canopy.
                Insects constantly gnaw at her ankles and the sweat stings her eyes. Her companion, a small white owl,
                hoots impatiently. She bends down to retrieve the bottle that is the focus of her task. Inside, a tiny
                winged creature flutters and bashes the glass in frustration, its lips mouthing silent curses. The
                Witchling wonders what will become of the fairy; her mistress and mentor is oft cruel. "I won't be like
                that when I'm a full witch", she tells herself.</p>
