          <strong>Skazka </strong>is a homebrew dark-fantasy
          D&D campaign setting—a “living narrative” world of
          ruthless gods, eerie myths, and dangerous,
          transformative journeys. It blends original lore
          with Slavic/Norse tones and features a fragile
          multiversal “Veil,” the Shadow War’s legacy, and
          richly detailed factions and regions for play.

              and the forest seems to mimic the sound.
              A crow lands on a nearby branch to judge
              the visitor. It caws, perhaps in
              approval? Clutching the urn he has
              brought here, the warrior takes a deep
              breath and steps forward. This place is
              hallowed so he must tread carefully.

              Ku'Than's forested canopy. Insects

              sweat stings her eyes. Her companion, a
              small white owl, hoots impatiently. She
              bends down to retrieve the bottle that
              is the focus of her task. Inside, a tiny
              winged creature flutters and bashes the
              glass in frustration, its lips mouthing
              silent curses. The Witchling wonders
              what will become of the fairy; her
              mistress and mentor is oft cruel. "I

              Back where the soldier began his
              journey, the streets of Calarium are
              choked with the dust from passing horses
              and carts. A small child weaves through
              a crowd of merchants and soft skinned
              gentry. Spotting her mark, she
              approaches confidently. With practiced
              ease she feigns a trip and bumps into
              the unsuspecting gem cutter. With an
              apology she pushes away from the man,
              but not empty handed. The concealed
              blade in one hand has liberated a purse
              of its strings. Stepping casually away
              from the crowd she slips into a darkened
              alleyway to assess her work. Only five
              gold coins. Not bad, but not enough to
              get her to Ku'Than. That will have to
              wait, for now.

              Within the half-forgotten circle of
              statues, the Priestess kneels in the
              dust. Her fingertips graze the carved
              runes of Aeter, the Lightbringer, one of
              the revered Annarr. She chants in a
              cracked tongue until a sliver of dawn
              pierces the mist. A single beam ignites
              the glyph, and faint warmth spreads
              through her bones. In that moment, she
              is both shield and beacon—not in
              defiance of darkness, but because she
              has invited light to guide it.

              shattered shrine dedicated to Njord, the
              Stormlord, another name among the Annarr
              pantheon. Hidden in his ragged cloak is
              nothing but a handful of cracked
              coins—and perhaps a dying spark. He
              prays to Njord in a whisper so low the
              wind nearly steals it. The clouds stir.
              In the distance, thunder grumbles. A
              pale coin glows as if struck by
              lightning. The Beggar clutches it,
              though it burns, and knows he has
              invited more than charity—perhaps fate’s
              thunder.

              gentle yet powerful goddess who tended
              fields, flocks, and famines. His throat
              closes as he remembers the fields that
              starved and the people who wept. He lays
              his crown at her stone feet, murmuring,
              “Reap what I have sown poorly.” In
              answer, the mural’s blossoms bloom in
              dust and cracks—feathered petals
              drifting downward like hope. It doesn’t
              feed his lands yet, but it reminds him
              what he must repair.

              stands straighter, his resolve tempered

              itself. The moss quivers. From below,
              the ground trembles as if the land
