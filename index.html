      <h2 class="skz-viking">About Skazka</h2>
      <p>Skazka is a <b>Dungeons&Dragons</b> campaign setting shaped by forgotten myths, ruthless gods, and
        ancient magic. From haunted necropolises
        to whispering jungles, Skazka is a place where every shadow holds a story, and every path promises
        mystery, danger, and transformation.</p>
      <p>At its core, Skazka is a living narrative: immersive, richly textured, and deeply atmospheric. The world
        blends Slavic, Norse, and original mythologies into something new—something strange, lyrical, and
        menacing. The name itself, "Skazka," is derived from the Russian word for "fairy tale," but the tales
        here are anything but comforting. Instead, they are blood-soaked, ironic, and often tragic, where happy
        endings are hard-won — if they come at all.</p>
      <p>Players and readers enter Skazka through the eyes of complex characters — like the Thief, darting through
        city alleys in search of survival; the Witchling, bartering with spirits in the deep, enchanted
        woodlands; or the Warlord, weighed down by duty, standing before the bones of the dead. These
        individuals inhabit a world full of lore: sentient forests, cursed relics, crumbling empires, and gods
        that walk the earth.</p>
      <p>But Skazka is not only a setting — it’s a tone, a philosophy of storytelling. It asks you to embrace
        ambiguity, to question what’s real, and to find beauty in the strange and the broken. It rewards those
        who pay attention to detail and aren't afraid to dive into morally gray choices.</p>
      <p>Whether you're here to read its tales, play within its systems, or build your own stories in its shadowy
        corners, Skazka invites you in with a warning: in this world, magic has a price, and not every monster
        looks like one.</p>
      <p>Dare to enter. Skazka awaits.</p>

              necropolis of Dargav. The aging jetty
              creaks underfoot and the forest seems to mimic the sound. A crow lands on a nearby branch to
              judge the
              visitor. It caws, perhaps in approval? Clutching the urn he has brought here, the warrior
              takes a deep
              breath and steps forward. This place is hallowed so he must tread carefully.</p>

              Ku'Than's forested canopy.
              Insects constantly gnaw at her ankles and the sweat stings her eyes. Her companion, a small
              white owl,
              hoots impatiently. She bends down to retrieve the bottle that is the focus of her task.
              Inside, a tiny
              winged creature flutters and bashes the glass in frustration, its lips mouthing silent
              curses. The
              Witchling wonders what will become of the fairy; her mistress and mentor is oft cruel. "I
              won't be like
              that when I'm a full witch", she tells herself</p>

            <p class="skz-fc-text">Back where the soldier began his journey, the streets of Calarium are
              choked with the dust from passing
              horses and carts. A small child weaves through a crowd of merchants and soft skinned gentry.
              Spotting
              her mark, she approaches confidently. With practiced ease she feigns a trip and bumps into
              the
              unsuspecting gem cutter. With an apology she pushes away from the man, but not empty handed.
              The
              concealed blade in one hand has liberated a purse of its strings. Stepping casually away
              from the crowd
              she slips into a darkened alleyway to assess her work. Only five gold coins. Not bad, but
              not enough to
              get her to Ku'Than. That will have to wait, for now.</p>

              Priestess kneels in the dust. Her fingertips graze the carved runes of Aeter, the Lightbringer, one of the
              revered
              Annarr. She chants in a cracked tongue until a sliver of dawn pierces the mist. A single beam ignites the
              glyph, and
              faint warmth spreads through her bones. In that moment, she is both shield and beacon—not in defiance of
              darkness,
              but because she has invited light to guide it.</p>

              dedicated
              to Njord, the Stormlord, another name among the Annarr pantheon. Hidden in his ragged cloak is nothing but
              a handful
              of cracked coins—and perhaps a dying spark. He prays to Njord in a whisper so low the wind nearly steals
              it. The
              clouds stir. In the distance, thunder grumbles. A pale coin glows as if struck by lightning. The Beggar
              clutches it,
              though it burns, and knows he has invited more than charity—perhaps fate’s thunder.</p>

              of Frur the Fertile, the gentle yet powerful goddess who tended fields, flocks, and famines. His throat
              closes as he remembers the fields that starved and the people who wept. He lays his crown at her stone
              feet, murmuring, “Reap what I have sown poorly.” In answer, the mural’s blossoms bloom in dust and
              cracks—feathered petals drifting downward like hope. It doesn’t feed his lands yet, but it reminds him
              what he must repair.</p>

              stumbles across a half-buried relic inscribed with Skald, the cold-hearted Annarr whose name is both
              feared and revered. He presses his palm to the frost-carved syllables. A shiver races up his arm. In
              return, the relic breathes familiar bitterness into him—not to punish, but to sharpen. He stands
              straighter, his resolve tempered by regret, and turns back toward the world that cast him out.</p>

              veins of green creeping across the stones—each line shaped by the ancient Annarr, immortal stories in
              living form. In the damp gloom, he closes his eyes and calls for Skazka’s old will—not a name, but the
              world itself. The moss quivers. From below, the ground trembles as if the land breathes. His chains
              rattle. He doesn’t escape—but the world listens.</p>
