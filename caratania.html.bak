            <h2 class="tb-title">Politics</h2>
            <p>Caratania is a monarchy ruled by King Alaric IV, whose dynasty claims direct descent from Hrothgar
                Bloodlance himself. While the crown commands loyalty, it is the Church of Aeter that truly shapes
                Caratanian life. The Church, through its grand clergy and militant Shield of Dawn, wields enormous
                influence over law, custom, and governance. Priests serve as judges, inquisitors, and advisors to the
                nobility, ensuring that both throne and people remain steadfast in their devotion. This balance between
                monarch and church has forged a state where piety is inseparable from politics, and faith is not a
                private matter but the very lifeblood of public order.</p>
            <h2 class="tb-title">Population</h2>
            <P>Caratania counts a population of roughly 400,000 souls. The heart of the kingdom is the fortified city of
                Barasov, home to the royal court, and the high clergy. Beyond the city lie dozens of towns and
                villages scattered across the foothills of the Blood Mountains.</P>

            <p>Caratania is a brooding kingdom of mist-laden valleys and shadowed mountains, perched at the foot of
                the
                forbidding Blood Mountains. Its people are the descendants of warriors and martyrs, heirs to the
                unyielding defiance of Hrothgar Bloodlance and his companions who cast down the vampire lords of
                old.
                This land is one of superstition and faith, where every hearth bears charms against the restless
                dead
                and every household whispers prayers to Aeter, the Eternal Flame, before nightfall. Yet Caratania is
                not
                only a kingdom of vigilant hearts; it is also a land of rich vineyards and crimson wine, whose deep
                taste is said to carry both the sweetness of life and the memory of blood. It is a realm where
                legend
                and reality are woven so tightly that the people live in constant awe of their own history.</p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">The Cathedral of the Eternal Flame</h2>
            <p>A fortress-like basilica dedicated to Aeter that dominates the Barasov skyline. Its black stone walls
                rise like cliffs above the city, its
                spires crowned with perpetual torches said never to extinguish. Both citadel and sanctuary, it
                houses
                relics of the vampire wars and serves as the seat of the High Flamekeeper. </p>
            <h2 class="tb-title">The Royal Palace of House Bloodlance</h2>
            <p>A solemn stronghold at the heart of Barasov, where King Alaric IV and his court rule. Its walls
                are adorned with tapestries recounting the slaying of vampire lords.</p>
            <h2 class="tb-title">The Vineyards of town Valmere</h2>
            <p>ast and fertile fields that produce Caratania’s famed crimson wines, beloved across Kelos for their
                richness and depth.</p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Visiting Caratania</h2>
            <p>Travelers who enter Caratania will find themselves in a land both beautiful and foreboding. The
                vineyards
                produce some of the most celebrated wines in all of Kelos, rich and dark, favored by nobles and
                merchants alike. Visitors are often struck by the strong religious character of the
                people—processions
                wind through the streets, bells toll at every hour, and even the inns bear symbols of Aeter to ward
                off
                evil. Foreigners are welcomed warmly enough, but always with an edge of watchfulness, for strangers
                might carry shadows with them. The nights are long in Caratania, and no traveler forgets the weight
                of
                unseen eyes when the moonlight falls upon the mountains.</p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">The Moonlit Pass</h2>
            <p>A treacherous mountain road said to be haunted by the spirits of the vampire legions who once
                marched
                there. Travelers speak of ghostly lights flickering in the mist.</p>
            <h2 class="tb-title">The Pilgrim’s Market</h2>
