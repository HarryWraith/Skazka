                        <p>Magic in Skazka is a temperamental thing. It never wished to settle into flesh and
                                steel, and
                                so permanent enchantment is rare. Artifacts bound with long-lasting magic are
                                few and far between—power there is, but it flees metal and wood like shadows
                                flinch from
                                dawn. Potions, charms, and other ephemeral magics endure, but items made to last
                                often
                                do not.</p>
                        <p>This fracture in the weave of magic began nearly two millennia ago. Arms and
                                armour—once
                                vibrant with rune and incantation—started to dull. Enchanters found their
                                bindings
                                slipping; metals they had strengthened with ancient rites turned brittle. The
                                forge
                                cracked with panic; the spell faded before the heat cooled. From that day on, no
                                enchantment held for the ages—unless by some rare and terrible force.</p>
                        <p>This era defining moment became known as, 'The Fading'.</p>
                        <p>In the centuries that followed, the learned and the desperate alike sought answers.
                                Scholars
                                poured over crumbling scrolls, and enchanters risked their sanity in the forge.
                                They
                                turned from common iron and ashwood to rarer veins and stranger
                                grains—substances that
                                seemed to lie somewhere between the mundane and the arcane.</p>
                        <p>Two revelations came of their toil. The first: that some materials possessed
                                peculiar,
                                intrinsic qualities. Not quite magical, yet not wholly ordinary either. The
                                second: that
                                these same substances could cradle enchantments where iron and steel let them
                                slip away.
                        </p>
                        <p>But mastery came at a cost. To shape such things demanded uncommon talent, knowledge
                                hoarded
                                over lifetimes, and a body able to endure both heat and sorcery. The work was
                                punishing,
                                dangerous, and often fatal.</p>
                        <p>Among these rare mediums are whispered names: Mithril, bright and untarnishing;
                                Darkwood,
                                heavy with forgotten life; Soulglass, fragile yet perilous; and Voidsteel, cold
                                as the
                                grave. Some of these wonders cannot be mined or harvested on Skazka at all, and
                                none are
                                found in abundance.</p>
                        <p>Thus they are treasures beyond coin, coveted by kings, thieves, and dreamers alike.

                        <p>
                                Crafting with rare and exotic substances follows the same basic process as
                                working with
                                common metals like iron—but the difficulty is far greater. These materials are
                                fragile,
                                volatile, and demand exceptional precision. To attempt such work personally, a
                                character
                                must possess expertise (double proficiency) with the appropriate tools. Hiring
                                an
                                artisan is possible, but only a true master crafter can handle the task.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                                Due to the skill and risk involved, the guide price for crafting or
                                commissioning an
                                item from these materials is typically 15 to 20 times the normal cost.

                        <p>Crafting an item from exotic materials requires an uninterrupted stretch of work that
                                balances realism with playability. Historically, forging a suit of chain mail
                                could take
                                around 1,000 hours—far too burdensome for an RPG. In this system, crafting time
                                scales
                                instead by item type and rarity, keeping the feel of painstaking workmanship
                                without
                                stalling the adventure.</p>

                                        may record the knowledge in your own words and symbols. Because the
                                        learning is
                                        guided, no check is required to determine whether you grasp the

                                        was woven. From this process, you gain the insight needed to write your
                                        own
                                        formula, capturing the essence of the magic once bound to the item.</li>

                        <p>Crafting any magical item—whether a lasting artifact or a single-use

                        <h2 class="tb-title">Anchoring</h2>
                        <p>The act of imbuing an exotic item with magic is called Anchoring—binding the magic
                                permanently to the material. No tool proficiency check is required at this
                                stage, as
                                that skill was already tested during the creation of the exotic item itself.
                                However,
                                proficiency in the tool is still required.</p>
                        <p>Instead, the focus falls on the enchanter: whoever is imprinting their magic must
                                succeed on
                                an Arcana check. The DC is determined by the rarity of the magic item being
                                created, not
                                the rarity of the exotic material serving as its receptacle.</p>
                        <p>The time required to Anchor magic into an item is determined by the rarity of the
                                item being
                                created. However, the process is always completed in a single sitting and rarely
                                exceeds
                                24 uninterrupted hours.</p>
                        <p><strong>Note</strong>: two individual can combine their talents. Two players wishing
                                to make
                                a
                                magical sword can do so as long as between them they have the required skill
                                proficiencies. For example, Erica wants to enchant a sword with flame tongue.
                                She is
                                proficient with Arcana but does not know how to use Smithing Tools. That's no
                                problem
                                because she has hired a smith. Between them they can complete the Anchoring
                                process. The
                                Smith can properly heat the base sword while Erica casts the enchantments.</p>

                        <h2 class="tb-title" id="brewing">House rules: Brewing potions</h2>
                        <p>The art of brewing potions and salves is as old as Skazka itself, practiced by
                                hedge-witches
                                in shadowed cottages, court alchemists in candlelit towers, and wandering
                                herbalists who
                                gather their craft from the wild places of the world. For thousands of years,
                                this
                                tradition has been passed down through whispered recipes, careful
                                experimentation, and
                                the slow mastery of flame, glass, and leaf.</p>
                        <p>Skazka’s lands are rich with life, home to hundreds of herbs, roots, and flowers with
                                properties both wondrous and dangerous. To those with the patience to learn
                                their
                                secrets, these plants become the foundation of an art that balances knowledge,
                                instinct,
                                and—at times—magic itself.</p>
                        <p>Potion brewing is often divided into two distinct paths:</p>
                        <ul>
                                <li class="nodec"><strong>Herbal Brewing</strong> – Rooted in the natural world,
                                        herbal
                                        potions are
                                        created using a <strong>Herbalism Kit</strong>. These remedies emphasize
                                        healing, restoration, and the easing of ailments. They are the craft of
                                        healers,
                                        apothecaries, and wise-folk who know how to coax life’s essence from the
                                        earth.
                                        Herbal brewing covers any potion which cures, heals, neutralises or
                                        removes an
                                        effect.</li>

                                        magical
                                        potions require <strong>Alchemist’s Supplies</strong>. These concoctions
                                        may
                                        grant temporary powers, alter the body, or channel arcane energies into
                                        liquid
                                        form. The work of alchemists and enchanters, such brews are as perilous
                                        as they
                                        are potent.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Though not costly in materials, brewing demands dedication. Every potion
                                requires
                                time, patience, and effort—along with the mastery of a specific formula.
                                Without
                                such knowledge, even the simplest mixture is little more than flavored
                                water.
                                With it, however, the brewer can transform common herbs and arcane
                                reagents into
                                draughts capable of mending wounds, shielding the soul, or altering fate
                                itself.
                                The practiioner must also be proficient in the relevant tools.
                        </p>
                        <p>The rules and requirements for learning forumulas is the same as those set
                                out above

                        <p><strong>To summarise</strong>:</p>
                        <ul>
                                <li>You must be proficient with a <strong>Herbalism Kit</strong> or

                                <li>You must have immediate access to those tools.</li>
                                <li>You must know the formula for the potion you wish to make.</li>
                                <li>You must have the ingredients set out in the formula.</li>
                                <li>You must have a potion bottle, vial or flask in which to decant your
                                        finished concoction</li>
                                <li>Note: You do not need to pay an incidental cost for potion brewing
                                        like you
                                        must for crafting arcane items.</li>
                                <li>You must spend the required amount of time relatively uninterrupted.
                                        At the
                                        end, and only at the end, of the required time the potion is
                                        ready. For
                                        example, you can brew a potion of healing during a long rest.
                                        That does
                                        not stop you from taking a long rest; it assumes you begin the
                                        process
                                        and leave it brewing for the duration. If you were to be
                                        attacked during
                                        that time, your DM must decide what risk there is to the process
                                        or
                                        end product.</li>
                                <li>No skill check is required.</li>

                        <!----------------------------- Scribing scrolls----------------------->
                        <h2 class="tb-title">Scribing magical scrolls</h2>
                        <p>To the untrained eye, a wizard’s scroll might look like nothing more than elegant
                                script on
                                crisp vellum. But in truth, each scroll is the product of ritual, discipline,
                                and rare
                                materials — a conduit by which a spell is bound into physical form. In Skazka,
                                the
                                process of scribing a magical scroll is treated as a specialized craft, one
                                distinct
                                from simply “writing” — it is weaving magic.</p>
                        <p>The key ingredients for creation of magical scrolls are arcane ink and special
                                parchments.
                                Ordinary ink and paper will not suffice — they cannot hold the magical
                                geometries or
                                resist the energy infusion required.</p>
                        <p>The inks and parchments are graded by rarity tiers (common, uncommon, rare, very
                                rare,
                                legendary, etc.), and higher-level spells demand more exquisite grades.</p>
                        <p>A scribe must purchase or procure these materials before scribing begins; rare inks
                                or
                                parchments may be found only in wizard’s guilds, arcane libraries, or lost
                                ruins.</p>
                        <p>To inscribe a spell, the scribe must already know or be able to cast that spell (i.e.
                                it must
                                be among their prepared spells or known spell repertoire). Without that
                                knowledge, the
                                mystical binding fails (the scroll won’t “take”). The sage must also be
                                proficient in
                                Arcana.</p>
                        <p>As the scribe works, they channel their own magical insight, working the glyphs and
                                infusing
                                the arcane ink with the spell’s pattern, until it becomes a magical scroll.</p>
                        <p>To summarise:</p>
                        <ul>
                                <li>You must be proficient in <strong>Arcana</strong> </li>
                                <li>You must have the spell you wish to scribe prepared.</li>

                                        parchment.</li>
                                <li>You must have the material components of the spell you wish to scribe. </li>

                                        must for crafting arcane items.</li>

                        <h2 class="tb-title">Other consumable magic items</h2>
                        <p>Scrolls and potions are not the only consumable magic items that can be enchanted.
                                Dusts,
                                oils, ammunition and a range of other magical items are considered consumable;
                                that
                                is to say thir hold on magic is fleeting and fragile. They will not last
                                forever.
                                Crafting these items follows the rules for that items type, with one exception:
                                a
                                successful skill check is never required.
