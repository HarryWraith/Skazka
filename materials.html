                        <p><strong>Exotic materials</strong> give low‑level play a taste of wonder without
                                collapsing balance. True magic stays rare; materials are <em>quality
                                        modifiers</em>, not raw bonuses.</p>

                        <h2 class="skz-viking">History & context</h2>
                        <p>Magic in Skazka is a temperamental thing. It never wished to settle into flesh and steel, and
                                so permanent enchantment is rare. Artifacts bound with long-lasting magic are
                                few and far between—power there is, but it flees metal and wood like shadows flinch from
                                dawn. Potions, charms, and other ephemeral magics endure, but items made to last often
                                do not.</p>
                        <p>This fracture in the weave of magic began nearly two millennia ago. Arms and armour—once
                                vibrant with rune and incantation—started to dull. Enchanters found their bindings
                                slipping; metals they had strengthened with ancient rites turned brittle. The forge
                                cracked with panic; the spell faded before the heat cooled. From that day on, no
                                enchantment held for the ages—unless by some rare and terrible force.</p>
                        <p>This era defining moment became known as, 'The Fading'.</p>
                        <p>In the centuries that followed, the learned and the desperate alike sought answers. Scholars
                                poured over crumbling scrolls, and enchanters risked their sanity in the forge. They
                                turned from common iron and ashwood to rarer veins and stranger grains—substances that
                                seemed to lie somewhere between the mundane and the arcane.</p>
                        <p>Two revelations came of their toil. The first: that some materials possessed peculiar,
                                intrinsic qualities. Not quite magical, yet not wholly ordinary either. The second: that
                                these same substances could cradle enchantments where iron and steel let them slip away.
                        </p>
                        <p>But mastery came at a cost. To shape such things demanded uncommon talent, knowledge hoarded
                                over lifetimes, and a body able to endure both heat and sorcery. The work was punishing,
                                dangerous, and often fatal.</p>
                        <p>Among these rare mediums are whispered names: Mithril, bright and untarnishing; Darkwood,
                                heavy with forgotten life; Soulglass, fragile yet perilous; and Voidsteel, cold as the
                                grave. Some of these wonders cannot be mined or harvested on Skazka at all, and none are
                                found in abundance.</p>
                        <p>Thus they are treasures beyond coin, coveted by kings, thieves, and dreamers alike.</p>

                        <p>
                                Crafting with rare and exotic substances follows the same basic process as working with
                                common metals like iron—but the difficulty is far greater. These materials are fragile,
                                volatile, and demand exceptional precision. To attempt such work personally, a character
                                must possess expertise (double proficiency) with the appropriate tools. Hiring an
                                artisan is possible, but only a true master crafter can handle the task.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                                Due to the skill and risk involved, the guide price for crafting or commissioning an
                                item from these materials is typically 15 to 20 times the normal cost.
                        </p>
                        <h4 class="skz-viking">Attempting the craft</h4>
                        <p>Crafting an item from exotic materials requires an uninterrupted stretch of work that
                                balances realism with playability. Historically, forging a suit of chain mail could take
                                around 1,000 hours—far too burdensome for an RPG. In this system, crafting time scales
                                instead by item type and rarity, keeping the feel of painstaking workmanship without
                                stalling the adventure.</p>

                        <p>Items forged from these extraordinary materials possess the ability to hold a magical charge
                                permanently, making them exceedingly rare and valuable.</p>

                        <p>However, merely possessing such an item is not enough. Several conditions must be met before
                                the crafting process can even be attempted:</p>

                        <ol class="toc-list">
                                <li>Knowledge of the Formula — simply owning the formula is insufficient; the crafter
                                        must truly
                                        understand it.</li>
                                <li>Proper Investment — specialized equipment must be acquired at significant cost.</li>
                                <li>Tool Proficiency — the individual undertaking the work must be proficient with the
                                        appropriate
                                        tools.

                        <br>
                        <h4 class="skz-viking">Formulas</h4>
                        <p>Forumulas, can be acquired in several ways:</p>
                        <ol class="toc-list">
                                <li>Discovering another’s work: You may come into possession of a written formula
                                        through trade, theft, inheritance, or other means. However, simply owning it is
                                        not enough—you must decipher the formula to unravel its meaning. Such research
                                        is difficult, risky, and offers no guarantee of success. The requisite time must
                                        be spent researching the formula; this is relative to the rarity.</li>
                                <li>Being taught directly: When instructed by someone who already knows the craft, you
                                        may record the knowledge in your own words and symbols. Because the learning is
                                        guided, no check is required to determine whether you grasp the formula—it
                                        becomes yours without uncertainty.</li>
                                <li>Extracting knowledge from an item: By disenchanting a magical item within a
                                        crucible—a place that consumes magic itself—you can observe how its enchantment
                                        was woven. From this process, you gain the insight needed to write your own
                                        formula, capturing the essence of the magic once bound to the item.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <br>
                        <h4 class="skz-viking">Monetary investment</h4>
                        <p>Crafting any magical item—whether a lasting artifact or a single-use consumable—requires an
                                initial investment. This represents the purchase of alchemical glassware, volatile
                                powders, stabilizing reagents, or other specialized equipment. Players are not expected
                                to detail the exact components. Instead, this expense is abstracted into an incidentals
                                fee, the value of which is determined by the item’s rarity.</p>

                        <p>The act of imbuing an exotic item with magic is called Anchoring—binding the magic
                                permanently to the material. No tool proficiency check is required at this stage, as
                                that skill was already tested during the creation of the exotic item itself.</p>
                        <p>Instead, the focus falls on the enchanter: whoever is imprinting their magic must succeed on
                                an Arcana check. The DC is determined by the rarity of the magic item being created, not
                                the rarity of the exotic material serving as its receptacle.</p>
                        <p>The time required to Anchor magic into an item is determined by the rarity of the item being
                                created. However, the process is always completed in a single sitting and rarely exceeds
                                24 uninterrupted hours.</p>
