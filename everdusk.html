            <h4 class="skz-viking">Population</h4>
            <p>Roughly 8,500 elves call Everdusk home, their numbers spread thin across hundreds of hidden enclaves
                woven into the forest canopy. Families live in sprawling tree-homes carved without harm into trunks of
                giant oaks. The Wood Elves are reclusive yet tightly bonded to their kin, relying on
                archery, stealth, and druidic craft for survival. Outsiders rarely glimpse their true population, as
                Everdusk seems to allow its inhabitants to appear and vanish with the shadows.</p>
            <h4 class="skz-viking">Politics</h4>
            <p>Everdusk is governed by the Circle of Branches, a council of elders.
                Decisions are made communally, guided by reverence for the Gloom Wood itself. The Circle does not
                command; it interprets the will of the forest. Rarely, when grave threats arise, the Circle appoints a
                Voice of the Trees—a single leader who speaks for the wood and wields authority until the balance is
                restored.</p>

            <p>Everdusk lies hidden within the shadowed canopy of the Gloom Wood, a realm where twilight lingers and
                moonlight filters through endless leaves. For four millennia, the Wood Elves have dwelled here,
                descendants of the wandering Dark Elves and kin to the radiant Sun Elves. Unlike their cousins, they
                forsook stone and fire, choosing instead to weave their lives into the living forest. Their homes are
                not built upon the land but within it—lofty halls among branches, rope bridges spanning treetop to
                treetop, and platforms where the green canopy serves as both roof and sky.</p>

            <h4 class="skz-viking">The Moon Bridge</h4>
            <p>A silver-threaded rope bridge that appears only under moonlight, glowing faintly as though woven from
                starlight. It marks the official threshold into Everdusk and spans a nameless river in a gorge deep
                below.</p>

            <h4 class="skz-viking">The Silmwood Groves</h4>
            <p>
                Sacred stands of silmwood trees, whose pale bark glimmers under moonlight. The bark can only be
                harvested at night, and when properly gathered it becomes a key ingredient in enchantments,
                spell-scrolls, and living wards.
            </p>

            <h4 class="skz-viking">Canopy Markets</h4>
            <p>
                A suspended gathering place high above the forest floor, where elves trade fruits, herbs, and moonlit
                crafts. Lanterns of captured glowmoths illuminate the night, creating a shimmering constellation among
                branches.

            <h2 class="skz-viking">Visiting Everdusk</h2>
            <p>Foreigners who wander the Gloom Wood seldom reach Everdusk unbidden—its paths are treacherous and
                patrols of silent rangers keep a watchful eye. Guests are guided blindfolded until they reach the
                Moon-Bridge, the
                ceremonial entrance into Everdusk. Hospitality is offered with caution: visitors are expected to show
                reverence for the forest and to harm no living thing under its canopy. Those who come in peace may be
                shown wonders; those who betray the forest’s trust are never seen again.</p>

            <h4 class="skz-viking">Hall of whispering leaves</h4>
            <p>
                A council platform encircling a colossal oak, where the Circle of Branches meets. It is said that the
                oak itself murmurs wisdom when the wind passes through its boughs.
            </p>

            <h4 class="skz-viking">Everfalls</h4>
            <p>
                A waterfall cascading through the heart of the forest, its mist imbued with faint magical energy.
                Platforms and rope paths cross its roaring descent, and nearby shrines honor the forest spirits.
            </p>

            <h4 class="skz-viking">The Glade of silent arrows</h4>
            <p>
                A hidden training ground for the rangers of Everdusk, where targets are set among shadows and leaves.
                Here, archers learn to loose arrows so silent that no prey hears them before it is struck.
