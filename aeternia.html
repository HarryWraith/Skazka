            <h2 class="tb-title">Politics</h2>
            <p>A empire governed by an Emperor who is currently Shemon Starr, along with a council of Senators which
                represent each district within the Empire.</p>
            <h2 class="tb-title">Population</h2>
            <P>The population of the Aeternian empire is around a million souls. Mostly Sun Elves but other races live
                peacefully there. Eldinun is the most populous city with around 600,000 inhabitants.</P>

            <p>Aeternia, formally known as the Aeternian Empire, is a realm draped in timeless majesty, where legend and
                history entwine as seamlessly as root and branch. Stretching from the rugged western coast of Kelos to
                the gentle flow of the River Lool, and northward to the snow-touched town of Winter, Aeternia has stood
                for at least five millennia as one of the oldest nations still breathing its ancient songs into the
                world.</p>
            <p>This is a land predominantly of elves, descendants of those who, long ago, answered the call of the god
                Aeter. He greeted them as they rose from the shadowed Underworld, offering sanctuary beneath the green
                canopy of endless forests. In their devotion and artistry, they shaped the empire into a living
                testament of harmony between divine blessing and mortal will.</p>
            <p>Though Aeternia’s dominion spans vast forestland, its heart is a singular marvel: Eldinun, a city without
                equal. Carved from luminous white marble quarried from the land itself, Eldinun sprawls like a shining
                jewel set amid emerald woods. Its towers rise like frozen starlight, and its streets seem to shimmer
                with the memory of ages past. Along the River Lool, towns and villages flourish, and in the clearings of
                the great forests, farming communities nurture the empire’s lifeblood.</p>
            <p>Among the places most revered stands the Cave Temple of Sinari, hidden in the northern hills. Once, it
                cradled the Everlight, an artifact said to hold a fragment of Aeter’s own flame, casting radiance that
                banished every shadow. Though the Everlight has long since departed, the temple resections a sacred
                site,
                drawing pilgrims from every corner of the empire.</p>
            <p>The Aeternian Empire is guided by its Emperor, presently Shemon Starr, whose reign extends over the vast
                districts of Eldinun and beyond. Each district sends forth a Senator, chosen by the people, to serve in
                counsel, giving voice to the many within the unity of the whole. Thus, Aeternia’s governance reflects
                both the enduring hand of divine mandate and the living chorus of its people.</p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">The Whispering Glades</h2>
            <p>A sacred forest grove where the trees are said to echo voices from ages past. Pilgrims come to hear
                faint
                whispers—believed to be the counsel of ancestors or fragments of Aeter’s voice carried on the wind.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">The River Lool Bridges</h2>
            <p>Dozens of stone bridges carved by elven artisans span the River Lool. Each one is unique, etched with
                reliefs depicting tales of creation, triumph, and sorrow. The Moonveil Bridge is especially famous,
                glowing silver beneath starlight as though woven from moonlight itself.</p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Eldinun’s Marble Spires</h2>
            <p>The heart of the Empire, Eldinun’s white marble towers rise like frozen starlight above the forest
                canopy. Each spire has a name and story—such as the Spire of Aeter’s Dawn, where the Emperor holds
                ceremonies to honor the god who founded the nation.</p>

            <h2 class="skz-viking">Visiting The Aerternian Empire</h2>
            <p>To walk within Aeternia is to step into a land that breathes with living history. For travelers, Eldinun
                is the crown jewel—a city where every avenue is flanked by white marble archways, every square hosts
                fountains that sparkle under moonlight, and every district offers its own character. Markets bustle with
                artisans selling glasswork that glimmers like captured dawn, silks woven with threads that shift colors
                in sunlight, and foods flavored with herbs grown only in the deep forest clearings.</p>
            <p>Elven hospitality is marked by quiet grace: a visitor is welcomed with spiced wine and song, often
                beneath vaulted halls where the acoustics carry every note like a prayer. Inns are rare in the
                traditional sense, for locals often open their homes to travelers, offering comfort in exchange for
                stories of distant lands.</p>
            <p>Life in Aeternia moves to the rhythm of the forest. Dawn brings soft flutes played in the courtyards,
                midday sees the markets in full bloom, and evening is a time for gatherings under lantern-lit canopies,
                where music and dance celebrate the harmony of people and nature. Festivals are plentiful, often tied to
                celestial events, when the streets are filled with lights and the forests echo with laughter until dawn.
            </p>
            <p>Travelers are encouraged to visit the River Lool, where riverboats glide silently through misty waters,
                offering views of both wild beauty and ancient stone bridges carved with tales of gods and heroes. The
                northern pilgrimage route to the Cave Temple of Sinari resections a journey of reverence and quiet awe,
                while those venturing to Winter will find a town where snow and song mingle, and the architecture seems
                sculpted from frost itself.</p>
            <p>In Aeternia, even the simplest paths carry echoes of eternity. Whether wandering Eldinun’s marble
                streets, listening to the whisper of the trees, or standing before the sanctuaries of old, every visitor
                finds themselves part of a story that began long before their arrival—and will endure long after their
                departure.</p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Sinari Cave Temple</h2>
            <p>Carved deep into the northern mountains, this temple once held the Everlight. Though the artifact has
                long vanished, the temple’s walls still shimmer faintly as though touched by its glow. Pilgrims leave
                offerings here, hoping to catch a glimmer of divine blessing.</p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">The Verdant Terraces</h2>
            <p>Vast stepped gardens carved into the hillsides west of Eldinun. Here, farming communities cultivate crops
                with intricate irrigation channels said to have been designed by Aeter himself. Festivals of harvest
                fill these terraces with music and lanterns.</p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">The Silverlight Amphitheatre</h2>
            <p>An open-air structure in Eldinun where music, poetry, and drama are performed. At night, enchantments
                woven into the marble cause the stage to shimmer with silvery radiance, enhancing performances with
                dreamlike beauty.</p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">The Starfallen Shrine</h2>
            <p>A secluded shrine in the western forests, said to mark where a star once fell from the heavens. The
                crater glows faintly at night, and its waters are believed to hold healing powers.</p>
