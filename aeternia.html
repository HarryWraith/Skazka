            <h2 id="overview" class="tb-title" style="margin-top:10px">Overview</h2>
            <p>Aeternia, formally known as the Aeternian Empire, is a realm draped in timeless majesty, where legend and
                history entwine as seamlessly as root and branch. Stretching from the rugged western coast of Kelos to
                the gentle flow of the River Lool, and northward to the snow-touched town of Winter, Aeternia has stood
                for at least five millennia as one of the oldest nations still breathing its ancient songs into the
                world.</p>
            <p>This is a land predominantly of elves, descendants of those who, long ago, answered the call of the god
                Aeter. He greeted them as they rose from the shadowed Underworld, offering sanctuary beneath the green
                canopy of endless forests. In their devotion and artistry, they shaped the empire into a living
                testament of harmony between divine blessing and mortal will.</p>
            <p>Though Aeternia&rsaquo;s dominion spans vast forestland, its heart is a singular marvel:
                <strong>Eldinun</strong>, a city without equal. Carved from luminous white marble, Eldinun sprawls like
                a shining jewel set amid emerald woods. Its towers rise like frozen starlight, and along the River Lool,
                towns and villages flourish while farming communities in forest clearings nurture the empire&rsaquo;s
                lifeblood.
            </p>
            <p>Among the most revered places stands the <strong>Cave Temple of Sinari</strong> in the northern hills.
                Once it cradled the Everlight—an artifact said to hold a fragment of Aeter&rsaquo;s flame, casting
                radiance
                that banished every shadow. Though the Everlight has long since departed, the temple remains a sacred
                site drawing pilgrims from every corner of the empire.</p>
            <p>The Empire is guided by its Emperor, presently <strong>Shemon Starr</strong>, whose reign extends over
                the vast districts of Eldinun and beyond. Each district sends forth a Senator, chosen by the people, to
                serve in counsel—giving voice to the many within the unity of the whole.</p>
            To walk within Aeternia is to step into a land that breathes with living history. For travelers, Eldinun is
            the crown jewel—a city where every avenue is flanked by white marble archways, every square hosts fountains
            that sparkle under moonlight, and every district offers its own character. Markets bustle with artisans
            selling glasswork that glimmers like captured dawn, silks woven with threads that shift colors in sunlight,
            and foods flavored with herbs grown only in the deep forest clearings.


            <p>Life in Aeternia moves to the rhythm of the forest. Dawn brings soft flutes played in the courtyards,
                midday sees the markets in full bloom, and evening is a time for gatherings under lantern-lit canopies,
                where music and dance celebrate the harmony of people and nature. Festivals are plentiful, often tied to
                celestial events, when the streets are filled with lights and the forests echo with laughter until dawn.
            </p>

            <p>Travelers are encouraged to visit the River Lool, where riverboats glide silently through misty waters,
                offering views of both wild beauty and ancient stone bridges carved with tales of gods and heroes. The
                northern pilgrimage route to the Cave Temple of Sinari resections a journey of reverence and quiet awe,
                while those venturing to Winter will find a town where snow and song mingle, and the architecture seems
                sculpted from frost itself.</p>

            <p>In Aeternia, even the simplest paths carry echoes of eternity. Whether wandering Eldinun’s marble
                streets, listening to the whisper of the trees, or standing before the sanctuaries of old, every visitor
                finds themselves part of a story that began long before their arrival—and will endure long after their
                departure.</p>

            <p>Elven hospitality is marked by quiet grace: a visitor is welcomed with spiced wine and song, often
                beneath vaulted halls where the acoustics carry every note like a prayer. Inns are rare in the
                traditional sense, for locals often open their homes to travelers, offering comfort in exchange for
                stories of distant lands.</p>
