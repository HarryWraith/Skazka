      <p>Lunica was said to be a huntress who thrived not by strength, but by cunning. Some stories claim she betrayed
        her
        hunting band, shifting her form into wolf, crow, and shadow to escape their vengeance. Others whisper she
        discovered
        the “true names” of beasts and men, allowing her to wear their flesh like a cloak. When she betrayed her final
        kin—her own brother Mani—Kronos or another cosmic power marked her with divine wrath, but instead of punishment,
        the
        mantle of divinity clung to her treachery. Now she hunts across worlds, ever-changing, ever-hungry, locked in
        endless war with Mani, who curses what she consumes and protects those she would betray.</p>

        <li><b>The silent feast</b>: ollowers gather, eat in absolute silence, and leave one seat empty for Lunica,
          symbolizing the ever-present possibility of betrayal.</li>
        <li><b>The rite of shattered bonds</b>: A follower ritually breaks an item once shared with another (a ring, a
          weapon, a keepsake) as an offering to invoke her power of severed trust.</li>

        <li>Some myths say Lunica betrayed Mani in life before godhood, stealing his prey and twisting his curses back
          upon
          him, which began their eternal feud.</li>
        <li>It is believed she wears a different form each night, and anyone met in the wild after dusk might be Lunica
          in
          disguise.</li>
        <li>Her eternal war with Mani is said to keep the balance between betrayal and consequence, hunter and hunted.
