  <p>Lunica was said to be a huntress who thrived not by strength, but by cunning. Some stories claim she betrayed her
    hunting band, shifting her form into wolf, crow, and shadow to escape their vengeance. Others whisper she discovered
    the “true names” of beasts and men, allowing her to wear their flesh like a cloak. When she betrayed her final
    kin—her own brother Mani—Kronos or another cosmic power marked her with divine wrath, but instead of punishment, the
    mantle of divinity clung to her treachery. Now she hunts across worlds, ever-changing, ever-hungry, locked in
    endless war with Mani, who curses what she consumes and protects those she would betray.</p>

    <li><b>The offering of skins</b>: Hunters and shapeshifters leave animal pelts or masks at her shrines, hoping to
      gain her blessing in disguise or pursuit.</li>

      symbolizing the ever-present possibility of betrayal.</li>
    <li><b>The rite of shattered bonds</b>: A follower ritually breaks an item once shared with another (a ring, a
      weapon, a keepsake) as an offering to invoke her power of severed trust.</li>

      disguise.</li>
