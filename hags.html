      <p>Once celebrated for their beauty and arcane prowess, the Four Hags were powerful witches who sought immortality
        at any cost. Their ambition led them to strike a pact with Siluthis, the enigmatic god of decay and entropy.
        True to his word, Siluthis granted them eternal lifeâ€”but at a steep price. Their bodies aged relentlessly, their
        once-vibrant forms withering into grotesque reflections of their former selves. Over time, their true names
        faded into obscurity, and they became known only as the Hags of Famine, Pestilence, Decay, and Madness.
        Embracing their new identities, they cultivated a following of devoted worshippers, elevating themselves to the
        status of minor deities within the pantheon of SkazkaWorld.</p>

      <ul class="nodec">
        <li><b>Rite of withering</b>: A sacrificial ceremony where followers offer their vitality to the Hags,
          symbolizing the acceptance of decay and the relinquishing of life force.</li>
        <li><b>Plague embrace</b>: An act by why a contagion is intentionally contracted and spread, believed to purify
          and strengthen the body through suffering.</li>
        <li><b>Veil of madness</b>: A trance-inducing rite that allows worshippers to glimpse the distorted truths of
          the universe, often leading to temporary or permanent insanity.</li>
        <li>Legends tell of a curse placed upon the Hags by a rival coven, causing their physical forms to deteriorate
          while their spirits remained intact. This curse bound them to their domains, ensuring their influence
          persisted through the ages. </li>

          with contagion.</li>
        <li><b>Madness</b>: The territory of delirium and insanity, where minds unravel, and reality becomes a malleable
          nightmare.</li>

        <li>In their quest for immortality, the Hags made a fateful bargain with Siluthis, god of decay. They gained
          eternal life, but their bodies aged and withered, a constant reminder of their hubris.</li>
        <li>As their influence grew, the Hags attracted a following of devotees who revered them as embodiments of
          necessary suffering and change. Their cults spread across SkazkaWorld, often operating in secrecy.</li>
        <li>Their influence is centred most strongly around Blightmire.</li>
