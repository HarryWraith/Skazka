      <!-- ===== Overview ===== -->
      <h2 id="overview" class="tb-title">Overview</h2>
      <p>Once celebrated for their beauty and arcane prowess, the Four Hags were powerful witches who sought immortality
        at any cost. Their ambition led them to strike a pact with Siluthis, the enigmatic god of decay and entropy.
        True to his word, Siluthis granted them eternal life—but at a steep price. Their bodies aged relentlessly, their
        once-vibrant forms withering into grotesque reflections of their former selves. Over time, their true names
        faded into obscurity, and they became known only as the Hags of Famine, Pestilence, Decay, and Madness.
        Embracing their new identities, they cultivated a following of devoted worshippers, elevating themselves to the
        status of minor deities within the pantheon of SkazkaWorld.

    <!-- ===== Influence
 ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="domains">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Influence</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Famine</strong>: The domain of hunger and deprivation, where sustenance is scarce, and survival is a
          constant struggle.</li>
        <li><strong>Pestilence</strong>: The realm of disease and decay, where sickness spreads unchecked, and the air
          is thick with contagion.</li>
        <li><strong>Madness</strong>: The territory of delirium and insanity, where minds unravel, and reality becomes a
          malleable nightmare.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Symbols  ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="symbols">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Symbols</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The withered crown</strong>: A decaying circlet, symbolizing the eternal yet deteriorating nature of
          the Hags' immortality.</li>
        <li><strong>The hollow chalice</strong>:An empty goblet, representing the insatiable hunger and disease they
          spread.</li>
        <li><strong>The cracked mirror</strong>: A shattered reflection, embodying the madness and distorted perceptions
          they induce.</li>

    </div>

    <!-- ===== Tenets ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="tenets">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Tenets</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>All Things Rot Rightly — Preserve nothing past its time. Let empires, bodies, and vows collapse when the
          grain loosens. Interference against decay is heresy.</li>
        <li>Hunger Honors the End — Feed entropy: unmake what clings—false promises, hoarded luxuries, stagnant lore.
          Leave offerings that spoil, so the god may feast.</li>
        <li>Truth is the Fracture — Gaze into the crack, not the gloss. Accept the self in broken reflections; wisdom
          lives in the split, not the mask.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Rites & Offerings ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="rites">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Rites</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Rite of withering: A sacrificial ceremony where followers offer their vitality to the Hags, symbolizing the
          acceptance of decay and the relinquishing of life force.</li>
        <li>Plague embrace: An act by why a contagion is intentionally contracted and spread, believed to purify and
          strengthen the body through suffering.</li>
        <li>Veil of madness: A trance-inducing rite that allows worshippers to glimpse the distorted truths of the
          universe, often leading to temporary or permanent insanity.</li>
        <li>Legends tell of a curse placed upon the Hags by a rival coven, causing their physical forms to deteriorate
          while their spirits remained intact. This curse bound them to their domains, ensuring their influence
          persisted through the ages.</li>

    <div class="tb-panel" id="lore">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Lore</h2>
      <p>
        In their quest for immortality, the Hags made a fateful bargain with Siluthis, god of decay. They gained eternal
        life, but their bodies aged and withered, a constant reminder of their hubris.
