      <p>They say Surrana was once the most desired courtesan in all the realms, her beauty so sharp it cut kings and
        beggars
        alike. Yet desire is a fickle thing, and when she spurned the advances of a high priest, he cursed her with a
        hunger
        that no touch could sate. For years, she wandered through flesh and passion like a starving wolf, until the
        night she
        found herself at a shrine to some long dead power. Silently, she offered it the last thing she owned — her
        mortal soul —
        if only to end her pain. Whoever or whatever it was accepted the gift. In return Surrana
        no longer worshiped love — she was love, and lust, and the ruin they bring.</p>

        <li><b>The kiss of shadows</b>: Initiates embrace a stranger in darkness, seeking the thrill of temptation
          without knowing the partner’s identity.</li>
        <li><b>The lash and bloom</b>: A ritual using light pain, like pinches or a gentle whip, paired with offerings
          of flowers or honey to invoke balance between pleasure and suffering.</li>

      <ul class="nodec">
        <li>
          Surrana once walked the mortal world as a courtesan, whose beauty and wit made kings crumble and priests
          curse. Her ascension was sealed when she consumed the essence of a forgotten god of ecstasy.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is said that Surrana’s favor can make a heart burn with desire or twist it with obsession—her touch is
          blessing and curse alike.
        </li>
        <li>
          Legends tell that those who worship her openly invite temptation into their homes; mirrors in a Surrana shrine
          are said to reflect not the body, but the deepest longing of the soul.
