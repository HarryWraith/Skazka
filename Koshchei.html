        <li><b>The Black Coin</b>: Mark of his order, carried by his Brides and Grooms. One face bears a pierced heart,
          the other strangling hands. It represents both the warning and the inevitability of his vengeance.</li>
        <li><b>The bound thread</b>: length of black cord or twine, tied in intricate knots. To his followers, it
          represents the binding of a wrongdoer’s fate. It is often used in their rites to tether a target’s soul to
          Koshchei’s will.</li>
        <li><b>The hollow heart</b>: A cracked vessel, sometimes crafted of bone, glass, or obsidian. It signifies both
          betrayal and emptiness, and is said to be a shadow of the vessel that holds Koshchei’s own hidden soul.</li>

      <p>Koshchei, sometimes called The Withered Bridegroom or The Immortal Spite, is a demi-god who dwells in the
        borderlands between life and death, feeding on bitterness, broken promises, and betrayed love. Unlike greater
        gods, Koshchei does not rule over temples or nations; instead, he whispers to the wronged and dispossessed,
        offering them the cold comfort of retribution.</p>
      <p>To his worshippers—known as Brides and Grooms—Koshchei represents both justice and cruelty: a force that
        balances the scales when mortal laws fail. He is neither wholly evil nor merciful, but an arbiter of pain,
        weaving vengeance into the destiny of those who call upon him.</p>
      <p>Koshchei is said to appear as a gaunt, pale man draped in black funeral garb, his eyes hollow yet burning
        faintly with silver fire. In his hands, he always holds something bound—threads, chains, or a heart of glass. He
        is both jailer and liberator, an immortal who cannot die because his soul is hidden beyond reach.</p>

      <ul class="nodec">
        <li><b>The gift of the black coin</b>: A ritual act performed to mark the target. The Bride or Groom prepares a
          black coin through whispered curses and an offering of blood, then delivers it to the victim. From that
          moment, the condemned’s fate belongs to Koshchei.</li>
        <li><b>The knotting of spite</b>: Performed by Brides on behalf of petitioners. They take a black cord and knot
          it while the wronged person recounts their grievances. The cord is then hidden beneath the victim’s bed, in
          their clothing, or near their home. As long as the knots remain tied, the target’s vitality weakens.</li>
        <li><b>The Moon's witness</b>: If a mark resists restitution until the dawn of the eighth day, the Bride or
          Groom invokes this rite under the waning moon. Blood—often from the petitioner’s hand—is smeared across the
          hollow heart symbol. From then until the new moon, the demi-god demands their life.</li>

          immortality.</li>
        <li><b>Decay and withering</b>: The slow wasting away of vitality, beauty, and hope—yet also the breaking down

      <h3 class="skz-viking">Lore</h3>
      <ul class="nodec">
        <li>It is said the first Bride of Koshchei was a woman betrayed by her husband, who sought justice where none
          would come. She drowned herself in grief, and Koshchei, pitying or perhaps hungering, bound her soul into his
          service. All Brides since trace their lineage to her shadow.</li>
        <li>Old tales whisper that Koshchei cannot be slain, for his soul is hidden in an egg inside a bird, inside a
          beast, inside a box—buried deep where no hand may reach. Brides and Grooms argue endlessly whether this is
          literal or symbolic, but all agree that his immortality is the source of his power.</li>
        <li>Folklore warns that any who ignore a black coin will feel their shadow lengthen unnaturally after the
          seventh dawn. By the eighth, the shadow whispers their name back to them, a sure sign that Koshchei’s claim
          has begun.</li>
