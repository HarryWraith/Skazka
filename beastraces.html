            <h2 class="tb-title">Overview</h2>

            <p>
                The beast races of Skazka represent some of the realm's most enigmatic inhabitants—beings whose forms
                blend humanoid and bestial characteristics in ways that speak to origins beyond normal reality. These
                peoples, including Centaurs, Kenku, Owlkin, Aarakocra, Harengon, and Yuan-ti, stand apart from other
                major races whose origins can be traced through conventional means. They are living bridges between
                Skazka and distant realms, carrying within their very forms memories of worlds that may no longer exist.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the heart of every Gnome lies an insatiable curiosity and an unshakable desire to solve problems. To
                them, the world is not something to be endured, but a puzzle waiting for solutions. Their smiths design
                weapons and tools that adapt to conditions, their alchemists brew concoctions that make life safer and
                easier, and their engineers devise mechanisms that save lives in mines or make simple tasks more
                efficient. Gnomes are not driven by conquest, wealth, or glory—though these may come as side effects—but
                by the joy of discovery and the satisfaction of creating something that improves the lives of others.
                They embody the belief that progress need not come from sacrifice, but from dedication, creativity, and
                the clever application of knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                Integration varies significantly among beast race individuals and communities. Some choose open
                integration, living visibly among other peoples and serving as ambassadors for their kind, despite
                facing prejudice and suspicion. Others prefer concealment, using magic or careful presentation to hide
                their true nature during interactions with predominantly humanoid settlements. Most settlements
                resection deliberately small to avoid unwanted attention, specializing in activities that utilize their
                unique capabilities. The floating city of Vitsenholm represents their greatest success in integration,
                serving as both a refuge and a center where beast races achieve actual representation in governance and
                leadership, proving they can not only participate in civilization but lead it.

            <p>
                Floating 300 feet above ancient desert ruins, Vitsenholm stands as the most remarkable achievement of
                beast race civilization in Skazka. Founded in 921 when archaeologists accidentally activated a
                mysterious artifact called the Great Engine, this aerial metropolis represents both a magical research
                center and the only place where beast races achieve significant population concentrations. While
                inhabitants from all races can be found within its floating districts, there exists a natural
                demographic skew that favors beast races, particularly those with innate magical abilities. Aarakocra
                and Thri-Kreen form the dominant populations, alongside substantial communities of Leonin, Loxodon,
                Tabaxi, and Owlkin. For beast races across the realm, Vitsenholm offers more than mere acceptance—it
                provides actual representation in governance, leadership in magical research, and a society where their
                unique perspectives are essential rather than merely tolerated.

            <h3 class="tb-title">Owlkin</h3>
            <p>Night-eyed and whisper-winged, owlkin move like a hush across rafters and boughs; their feathers drink
                moonlight, their pupils cut the dark to silver threads. They see twice as far in gloom as most and fly
                on broad, silent wings, often training as scouts and lore-runners. Many keep the habits of stealth as a
                craft, treating footfalls, breath, and cloth as tools to tune.</p>

            <h3 class="tb-title">Leonines</h3>
            <p>
                Sun-proud and straight-spined, leonin stride with a courtly ferocity. Claws and speed give them the
                initiative, but it’s their battle voice—a thunderous roar that unmans foes once between rests—that turns
                skirmishes. They prize plain dealing, duel-speeches, and the clean hunt; prides mark territory with
                brass and bright cloth rather than skulls.

            <h3 class="tb-title">Tabaxi</h3>
            <p>All spring and stare, tabaxi pad light until the moment breaks—then unleash a burst of impossible speed
                that eats the field in heartbeats before settling back to a watchful prowl. Keen eyes and clever hands
                serve climbers, couriers, and story-thieves; claws and curiosity open as many doors as they scratch.</p>

            <h3 class="tb-title">Minotaur</h3>
            <p>Broad as gateposts and horn-crowned, minotaurs make corridors of their own. When the blood calls they
                lower their heads and drive with the horns, goring on impact or hammering foes back to make space for
                the herd. Their maps live in memory; many can retrace a path by scent, weight, and wall-echo long after
                torches die.</p>

            <p>Salt-wise and even-tempered, tortles wear their shell as living armor, shrugging off blows that would
                fold others; when danger swells they can turtle down, trading motion for near-impenetrable defense.
                Patient lungs and steady hands suit navigators, divers, herbalists—folk who measure life by tides and
                take the long way home.</p>
