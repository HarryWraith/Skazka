            <h4 class="skz-viking">Physical Description</h4>
            <p>Each beast race displays distinctive physical traits that immediately mark them as different from
                conventional humanoids. Centaurs possess the torso of a human atop the body of a horse, while Aarakocra
                display prominent avian features including wings and beaks. Yuan-ti exhibit serpentine characteristics
                in their skin, eyes, and sometimes body structure. Harengon bear rabbit-like features including
                elongated ears and quick, agile movements, while Owlkin possess the keen eyes and nocturnal adaptations
                of their avian counterparts. Kenku display corvid features and possess the supernatural ability to
                perfectly mimic any sound they hear.</p>

            <p>The beast races of Skazka represent some of the realm's most enigmatic inhabitants—beings whose forms
                blend humanoid and bestial characteristics in ways that speak to origins beyond normal reality. These
                peoples, including Centaurs, Kenku, Owlkin, Aarakocra, Harengon, and Yuan-ti, stand apart from other
                major races whose origins can be traced through conventional means. They are living bridges between
                Skazka and distant realms, carrying within their very forms memories of worlds that may no longer exist.

            <h4 class="skz-viking">Heritage</h4>
            <p>Unlike other races in Skazka, the beast races appear to have arrived through "the veil"—a mysterious
                barrier separating worlds—though whether this crossing was intentional, accidental, or driven by cosmic
                forces remains unknown. Their cultural traditions and fragmented memories hint at otherworldly origins:
                Centaur legends speak of grasslands under alien stars, Aarakocra songs describe impossible mountain
                peaks, and Harengon folklore tells of fields with flowers in colors that have no earthly names. These
                half-remembered glimpses provide cultural identity while creating a perpetual sense of displacement.</p>

            <h2 class="skz-viking">Motivation</h2>
            <p>At the heart of every Gnome lies an insatiable curiosity and an unshakable desire to solve problems. To
                them, the world is not something to be endured, but a puzzle waiting for solutions. Their smiths design
                weapons and tools that adapt to conditions, their alchemists brew concoctions that make life safer and
                easier, and their engineers devise mechanisms that save lives in mines or make simple tasks more
                efficient. Gnomes are not driven by conquest, wealth, or glory—though these may come as side effects—but
                by the joy of discovery and the satisfaction of creating something that improves the lives of others.
                They embody the belief that progress need not come from sacrifice, but from dedication, creativity, and
                the clever application of knowledge.</p>
            <h2 class="skz-viking">Integration into Society</h2>
            <p>Integration varies significantly among beast race individuals and communities. Some choose open
                integration, living visibly among other peoples and serving as ambassadors for their kind, despite
                facing prejudice and suspicion. Others prefer concealment, using magic or careful presentation to hide
                their true nature during interactions with predominantly humanoid settlements. Most settlements remain
                deliberately small to avoid unwanted attention, specializing in activities that utilize their unique
                capabilities. The floating city of Vitsenholm represents their greatest success in integration,
                serving as both a refuge and a center where beast races achieve actual representation in governance and
                leadership, proving they can not only participate in civilization but lead it.</p>
            <h2 class="skz-viking">Vitsenholm: The City of Beasts</h2>
            <p>Floating 300 feet above ancient desert ruins, Vitsenholm stands as the most remarkable achievement of
                beast race civilization in Skazka. Founded in 921 when archaeologists accidentally activated a
                mysterious artifact called the Great Engine, this aerial metropolis represents both a magical research
                center and the only place where beast races achieve significant population concentrations. While
                inhabitants from all races can be found within its floating districts, there exists a natural
                demographic skew that favors beast races, particularly those with innate magical abilities. Aarakocra
                and Thri-Kreen form the dominant populations, alongside substantial communities of Leonin, Loxodon,
                Tabaxi, and Owlkin. For beast races across the realm, Vitsenholm offers more than mere acceptance—it
                provides actual representation in governance, leadership in magical research, and a society where their
                unique perspectives are essential rather than merely tolerated.</p>
