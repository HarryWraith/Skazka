      <ul class="nodec">
        <li><b>The entwined dagger</b>: A curved dagger wrapped in spider silk, often depicted dripping with either
          blood or venom. This symbol represents Lolth's dual nature of seduction and betrayal - the silk appears
          delicate and beautiful, yet binds the weapon that delivers death.</li>
        <li><b>The inverted web</b>: An eight-pointed web turned upside down, with a single dewdrop at its center. The
          inverted nature represents the overturning of natural order and hierarchy, while the dewdrop symbolizes the
          tears of those caught in her schemes. Often carved into obsidian or woven with silver thread.</li>
        <li><b>The twin shadows</b>: Two overlapping silhouettes - one of a graceful drow maiden, the other of a massive
          spider - cast upon a wall or surface. This symbol appears spontaneously in places where Lolth's influence is
          strong, representing her shapeshifting nature and the duality of beauty and horror.</li>

      <p>Lolth stands as one of the most feared and reviled deities in Skazka's surface world, a lesser goddess whose
        influence far exceeds her divine rank through cunning and manipulation rather than raw power. Born of both drow
        and spider heritage, she possesses the ability to shift seamlessly between her seductive drow form and her
        terrifying arachnid shape, using whichever appearance best serves her current scheme. Known as the Weaver of
        Lies and the Spider Queen, Lolth delights in corruption, betrayal, and the systematic destruction of trust
        between mortals. Her beauty is matched only by her cruelty, and she is not above using her considerable sensual
        appeal as a weapon to ensnare victims in webs of desire and deceit. Those who worship her do so out of fear,
        ambition, or a twisted appreciation for her artistry in turning allies into enemies. While she claims dominion
        over the drow people, her true domain is chaos itself - she thrives in the shadows between conflicting factions,
        whispering poison into willing ears and watching civilizations tear themselves apart from within.</p>

      <h3 class="skz-viking">Rites</h3>
      <ul class="nodec">
        <li><b>Ritual of seven betrayals</b>: Performed during the new moon, this rite requires the participant to
          betray seven different individuals over the course of seven nights, each betrayal growing in magnitude. The
          ritual culminates with the betrayal of someone the participant claims to love. Successful completion grants
          Lolth's favor and enhanced magical abilities, particularly in illusion and enchantment magic. The ritual space
          is adorned with webs containing seven different types of venomous spiders.</li>
        <li><b>The web walkers communion</b>: A highly dangerous ritual where devotees allow themselves to be bitten by
          sacred spiders and then enter a trance-like state while suspended in specially consecrated webs. During this
          communion, participants experience visions of Lolth's desires and receive cryptic instructions for future
          schemes. Many who attempt this ritual die from the venom, which Lolth considers a natural culling of the weak.
        </li>
        <li><b>The dance of dual forms</b>: An elaborate ceremony performed by Lolth's priestesses, involving a complex
          dance that mimics the movements of both drow and spider. Participants gradually shed clothing and ornaments
          throughout the dance, symbolizing the shedding of false appearances. The ritual reaches its climax when the
          lead priestess shapeshifts (or magically appears to transform) between drow and spider forms. This rite is
          used to initiate new followers and to seek Lolth's blessing for major deceptions.</li>

      <h3 class="skz-viking">Domains</h3>
      <ul class="nodec">
        <li><b>Deception</b>: Lolth grants her clerics the power to weave illusions, speak honeyed lies that sound like
          truth, and see through the deceptions of others. Her followers excel at creating false identities, forging
          documents, and manipulating emotions through carefully crafted falsehoods.</li>
        <li><b>Strife</b>: The Spider Goddess thrives on conflict and division. Clerics of this domain can sow discord
          between allies, amplify existing tensions, and turn enemies against each other. They possess abilities to
          incite rage, create paranoia, and break bonds of trust and loyalty.</li>
        <li><b>Desire</b>: Perhaps her most insidious domain, this grants power over lust, obsession, and want. Her
          clerics can inflame passions, create unnatural attractions, and bind others through their deepest desires.
          This domain also governs the magic of seduction, charm, and emotional manipulation.</li>

      <h3 class="skz-viking">Lore</h3>
      <ul class="nodec">
        <li>Ancient texts speak of how Lolth was once a surface elf who made a pact with an ancient demon lord of
          spiders after being betrayed by her lover and exiled to the Underdark. The transformation into her current
          half-spider, half-drow form was both a curse and a gift - she gained immense power but lost her ability to
          truly love or trust. This origin story explains her obsession with betrayal and her particular hatred for
          surface elves and their gods.</li>
        <li>Lolth is said to maintain multiple courts throughout the Underdark where she appears in different guises,
          often playing various factions against each other without them realizing they serve the same goddess. These
          courts are elaborate stage plays of politics and intrigue, where every alliance is temporary and every
          friendship contains the seeds of future betrayal. Scholars believe she uses these courts to recruit her most
          promising servants and to test the loyalty and cunning of her existing followers.</li>
        <li>Drow lore speaks of an ancient prophecy stating that Lolth will one day weave a web so vast and complex that
          it will ensnare even the gods themselves, allowing her to ascend to greater divine power. This web is said to
          be made not of silk, but of the betrayals, broken oaths, and shattered alliances she has orchestrated
          throughout history. Some scholars believe this prophecy explains her seemingly random acts of manipulation -
          each one is actually a carefully planned strand in this ultimate web. The prophecy warns that when this web is
          complete, trust itself will become extinct from the world.</li>
