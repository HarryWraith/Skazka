      <!-- ===== Overview ===== -->
      <h2 id="overview" class="tb-title">Overview</h2>
      <p>Lolth stands as one of the most feared and reviled deities in Skazka's surface world, a lesser goddess whose
        influence far exceeds her divine rank through cunning and manipulation rather than raw power. Born of both drow
        and spider heritage, she possesses the ability to shift seamlessly between her seductive drow form and her
        terrifying arachnid shape, using whichever appearance best serves her current scheme. Known as the Weaver of
        Lies and the Spider Queen, Lolth delights in corruption, betrayal, and the systematic destruction of trust
        between mortals. Her beauty is matched only by her cruelty, and she is not above using her considerable sensual
        appeal as a weapon to ensnare victims in webs of desire and deceit. Those who worship her do so out of fear,
        ambition, or a twisted appreciation for her artistry in turning allies into enemies. While she claims dominion
        over the drow people, her true domain is chaos itself - she thrives in the shadows between conflicting factions,
        whispering poison into willing ears and watching civilizations tear themselves apart from within.

    <!-- ===== Influence
 ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="domains">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Influence</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Deception</strong>: Lolth grants her clerics the power to weave illusions, speak honeyed lies that
          sound like truth, and see through the deceptions of others. Her followers excel at creating false identities,
          forging documents, and manipulating emotions through carefully crafted falsehoods.</li>
        <li><strong>Strife</strong>: The Spider Goddess thrives on conflict and division. Clerics of this domain can sow
          discord between allies, amplify existing tensions, and turn enemies against each other. They possess abilities
          to incite rage, create paranoia, and break bonds of trust and loyalty.</li>
        <li><strong>Desire</strong>: Perhaps her most insidious domain, this grants power over lust, obsession, and
          want. Her clerics can inflame passions, create unnatural attractions, and bind others through their deepest
          desires. This domain also governs the magic of seduction, charm, and emotional manipulation.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Symbols  ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="symbols">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Symbols</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The entwined dagger</strong>: A curved dagger wrapped in spider silk, often depicted dripping with
          either blood or venom. This symbol represents Lolth's dual nature of seduction and betrayal - the silk appears
          delicate and beautiful, yet binds the weapon that delivers death.</li>
        <li><strong>The inverted web</strong>: An eight-pointed web turned upside down, with a single dewdrop at its
          center. The inverted nature represents the overturning of natural order and hierarchy, while the dewdrop
          symbolizes the tears of those caught in her schemes. Often carved into obsidian or woven with silver thread.
        </li>
        <li><strong>The twin shadows</strong>: Two overlapping silhouettes - one of a graceful drow maiden, the other of
          a massive spider - cast upon a wall or surface. This symbol appears spontaneously in places where Lolth's
          influence is strong, representing her shapeshifting nature and the duality of beauty and horror.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Tenets ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="tenets">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Tenets</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fracture the Bond — Make trust your prey. Turn allies into rivals; sow discord until every pact frays.</li>
        <li>Veil the Fang — Beauty is a blade. Practice deception and seduction as sacred crafts; hide the strike in
          silk.</li>
        <li>Weave the Greater Web — Betrayal is liturgy. Orchestrate layered schemes—desire as thread, lies as
          knots—each strand serving the ultimate web.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Rites & Offerings ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="rites">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Rites</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Ritual of Seven Betrayals — Over seven new-moon nights, betray seven people, each treachery greater than the
          last, ending with one you profess to love. Success wins Lolth’s favor and sharper illusion/enchantment. Webs
          hung with seven venoms mark the space.</li>
        <li>Web-Walker’s Communion — Submit to bites from sacred spiders, then hang in consecrated webs to trance and
          receive Lolth’s visions. Many die of the venom—her sanctioned culling.</li>
        <li>Dance of Dual Forms — Priestesses perform a shedding dance, mimicking drow and spider, casting off
          adornments to unveil true intent; the lead shifts (or seems to) between both forms. Used to initiate followers
          and bless great deceptions.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Avatars & Interventions ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="avatars">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Avatars</h2>
      <p>Lolth's true form is that of a Drider, but she is seen more often as a stunningly beautiful Dark Elf.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Lore ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="lore">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Lore</h2>
      <p>
        Ancient texts speak of how Lolth was once a surface elf who made a pact with an ancient demon lord of spiders
        after being betrayed by her lover and exiled to the Underdark. The transformation into her current half-spider,
        half-drow form was both a curse and a gift - she gained immense power but lost her ability to truly love or
        trust. This origin story explains her obsession with betrayal and her particular hatred for surface elves and
        their gods.
