                        <p>Gathering is designed to make <strong>herbalism</strong>, <strong>skinning</strong>,
                                <strong>foraging</strong> and <strong>hunting</strong> feel like an adventure activity,
                                not a shopping
                                trip. It adds flavor, rewards exploration, and scales with rarity—while staying light on
                                mechanics so it never drags down play.

                                <li>Incidental, Not Downtime – Gathering happens naturally during travel or exploration;
                                        it should never slow the game or consume separate adventuring time.</li>
                                <li>Environment – The type of terrain determines what can be found.</li>
                                <li>Skill + Tools Matter – Characters roll Nature/Survival checks and add proficiency

                        <p>
                                While traveling in the wilderness, a character with an herbalism kit (or similar
                                expertise) may
                                attempt a gathering check (usually Wisdom (Survival) or Intelligence (Nature)) to find
                                useful
                                ingredients. This check represents casually picking herbs, roots, mushrooms, salts or
                                crystals
                                along the way. In game terms, allow one such check per day of travel (or per suitable
                                exploration period) without spending extra hours – it’s an incidental action, not a full
                                “Downtime” day.

                        <p>
                                While traveling in the wilderness, a character with the right tools and skills
                                may attempt a gathering check to find useful ingredients. This check represents casually
                                picking
                                herbs, roots, mushrooms or hunting small game for skins & meat. In game terms, allow one
                                such
                                check per day of travel (or per suitable exploration period) without spending extra
                                hours – it’s
                                an incidental action, not a full “Downtime” day.
                        </p>

                        <p>The final yield is determined by the DM and should reflect the actual availability of the
                                resource. Even an excellent skill check cannot produce a large harvest if the resource
                                is naturally scarce; likewise, abundant environments may reward greater yields on a
                                success.</p>

                        <h2 class="skz-viking">Measuring success</h2><br>
                        <p>
                                Gathering requires a skill check against a DC, which can be modified by environmental
                                factors such as terrain, season, or outside influences (e.g. a nearby wolf pack). On a
                                success, the character collects usable reagents. The exact Yield is determined by how
                                successful the skill check was. Consult the Yield table at the bottom of this page.. <a
                                        href="tables.html">here</a>.

                        <h4 class="skz-viking">Skill checks & DC</h4><br>

                        <p>The base DC for all gathering checks is 10. This DC is then adjusted by situational factors
                                such as terrain, season, or other complications that make gathering more difficult. The
                                table below offers suggested modifiers, but it cannot account for every possible
                                circumstance—the DM should apply additional adjustments as needed.</p>

                        <p>Skinning requires proficiency with <strong>Leatherworker’s Tools</strong>. Each attempt calls
                                for a skill check, though the hunter and the skinner need not be the same person. Of
                                course, if the hunt fails, there is nothing to skin. Consult the table below for
                                suggested Yield. The chosen Yield for skinning must match the result of the hunt. For
                                example: if Cedric the hunter secures a successful Yield of 2 and chooses to roll on the
                                Uncommon table, Bob—the party’s skinner—may then attempt to skin the creature.</p>
                        <p>Keep in mind, however, that a successful hunt does not guarantee a successful skinning.
                                Further, the DC for skinning is based solely on the rarity of the creature that was
                                successfully hunted. Each individual beast you wish to skin requires its own skill
                                check.</p>

                        <h4 class="skz-viking">Yield</h4><br>
                        <p>Consult the table below. Once a Yield is determined, proceed to the generators <a
                                        href="tables.html">here</a>. The Yield column provides a numerical value that
                                represents the total number of rolls the player can make.</p>

                        <p>Note that when hunting or foraging, the <strong>Yield</strong> also represents how many
                                people can be sustained for one day. For example, a Yield of 3 from hunting combined
                                with 3 from foraging provides a total Yield of 6—enough to feed 6 people for one day, or
                                3 people for two days.</p>
                        <p><strong>Note</strong>: if your travel speed exceeds 'normal' pace then you cannot hunt or
                                forage. If
                                the party elects to move at a slower speed then foraging and hunting checks can be made
                                with advantage.</p>
