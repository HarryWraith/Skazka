                        <p>Gathering is designed to make <strong>herbalism</strong>, <strong>skinning</strong>,
                                <strong>foraging</strong> and <strong>hunting</strong> feel like an adventure activity,
                                not a shopping
                                trip. It adds flavor, rewards exploration, and scales with rarity—while staying light on
                                mechanics so it never drags down play.

                                <li>Incidental, Not Downtime – Gathering happens naturally during travel or exploration;
                                        it should never slow the game or consume separate adventuring time.</li>
                                <li>Environment – The type of terrain determines what can be found.</li>

                        <p>
                                While traveling in the wilderness, a character with an herbalism kit (or similar
                                expertise) may
                                attempt a gathering check (usually Wisdom (Survival) or Intelligence (Nature)) to find
                                useful
                                ingredients. This check represents casually picking herbs, roots, mushrooms, salts or
                                crystals
                                along the way. In game terms, allow one such check per day of travel (or per suitable
                                exploration period) without spending extra hours – it’s an incidental action, not a full
                                “Downtime” day.

                        <p>
                                While traveling in the wilderness, a character with the right tools and skills
                                may attempt a gathering check to find useful ingredients. This check represents casually
                                picking
                                herbs, roots, mushrooms or hunting small game for skins & meat. In game terms, allow one
                                such
                                check per day of travel (or per suitable exploration period) without spending extra
                                hours – it’s
                                an incidental action, not a full “Downtime” day.
                        </p>

                        <p>The final yield is determined by the DM and should reflect the actual availability of the
                                resource. Even an excellent skill check cannot produce a large harvest if the resource
                                is naturally scarce; likewise, abundant environments may reward greater yields on a
                                success.</p>

                        <h2 class="skz-viking">Measuring success</h2><br>
                        <p>
                                Gathering requires a skill check against a DC, which can be modified by environmental
                                factors such as terrain, season, or outside influences (e.g. a nearby wolf pack). On a
                                success, the character collects usable reagents. The exact amount is determined by how
                                successful the skill check was. Consult the 'margin of success' table at the bottom of
                                this page.. <a href="./gathering.html#yield">here</a>.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="skz-viking">Skill checks & DC</h4><br>

                        <p>The base DC for all gathering checks is 8. This DC is then adjusted by situational factors
                                such as terrain, season, or other complications that make gathering more difficult. The
                                table below offers suggested modifiers, but it cannot account for every possible
                                circumstance—the DM should apply additional adjustments as needed.</p>

                        <p>Foraging requires a <strong>Survival</strong> or <strong>Nature</strong> check. They are

                        <p>Hunting requires a <strong>Survival</strong> check. Checks are made with
                                <strong>disadvantage</strong> if you are not profcient. Determine the outcome
                                of your hunt then roll that number of times on the <a

                        <p>Skinning requires proficiency with <strong>Leatherworker’s Tools</strong>. Each attempt calls
                                for a skill check, though the skinner need not have hunted the beast you are attempting
                                to skin. Of course, if the hunt fails, there is nothing to skin..</p>

                        <p> Each individual beast successfully hunted can then be skinned. The rarity of that beast must
                                then be used to determine the skinning DC in the table below.

                        <p>Example: Hugglebear the hunter is tracking through a forest in deep winter (+5 DC).
                                This makes the DC 8 + 5 (13). She rolls a 16 giving a success margin of 3. margin
                                of success of 3 grants her two rolls on the hunting table.</p>

                        <p>First roll using 'Forest' determines a 'Ruffed Grouse' (Yield 1, common, feathers). For the
                                hunter this provides 1 food item; enough to feed one person for a day. In order
                                to 'skin' to obtain feathers the skinner must succeed on a DC 8 + 5 (13) Leatherworking
                                Tools check to safely remove the feathers without damaging them. Notes: as the DM I
                                decided that the penalty for Winter (+5) should still apply here because it is difficult
                                to work with cold hands. However, had the skinner taken the carcass inside and plucked
                                it before the hunter cuts it up for food I would have reduced that penalty.</p>
                        <p>The second roll determines a 'red deer' (Yield 5, uncomm, leather). For the hunter this
                                provides 5 units of food; enough to feed 5 people for a day. This time the skinning DC
                                is a flat 12 because the carcass was carried back to a nice warm cabin in the woods. The
                                check is a success and the hunter has obtained a deer hide.

                        <p><strong>Note</strong>: if your travel speed exceeds 'normal' pace then you cannot hunt or
                                forage. If the party elects to move at a slower speed then foraging and hunting checks
                                can be made with advantage.</p>
