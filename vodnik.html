            <h2 class="tb-title">Physical Description</h2>
            <p>Vodnik are diminutive beings with pitch-black skin that seems to absorb light. Their most striking
                feature is their eyes—deep crimson, glowing faintly in the dark. Their frames are slender and frail,
                lending to the illusion that they are little more than shadows given form. Some accounts insist that
                Vodnik can render themselves invisible, appearing only as a shimmer in the air or a fleeting movement
                caught in one’s peripheral vision.</p>

            <p>Vodnik are elusive Fay-like creatures, rarely seen and even more rarely understood. Small and
                shadowy,
                they dwell on the edges of perception, flickering in and out of view as if the world itself rejects
                their presence. Though not known to cause harm, their uncanny aura and strange effects on those
                nearby
                have left many wary of their nature. They are whispered of in tales across Ku’Than, most often
                connected
                to the haunted groves of the Weird Wood.</p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Heritage</h2>
            <p>The origins of the Vodnik are uncertain. Scholars debate whether they are descendants of lost Fay
                bloodlines, corrupted over time, or if they are children of the Shadow Realm itself. Their
                presence in
                Ku’Than is rare and mysterious, with no known settlements or gathering places—only occasional
                solitary
                figures glimpsed in the Weird Wood. Some theorists believe they are travelers between worlds,
                slipping
                through unseen thresholds when the veil between realms grows thin.</p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Motivation</h2>
            <p>Vodnik appear to lack the desires or ambitions of other races. They neither seek wealth, power, nor
                dominion. Instead, they seem driven by an instinct to remain hidden, to observe, and perhaps to
                protect
                their fragile connection to the Shadow Realm. Reports of travelers suddenly falling asleep in their
                presence suggest that they may use subtle psionic powers to defend themselves, or to ensure that
                unwanted intruders forget their fleeting encounter.</p>
            <h2 class="tb-title">Integration into society</h2>
            <p>Integration of Vodnik into wider society is virtually nonexistent. Their shy, secretive nature
                ensures
                that they avoid contact with outsiders, slipping away long before interaction can occur. On the rare
                occasion a Vodnik lingers near villages or roads, it is usually taken as an omen—sometimes of ill
                luck,
                sometimes of deep mystery. Without known settlements, culture, or language beyond faint gestures and
                eerie silence, Vodnik remain spectral outsiders, haunting the edges of civilization.</p>
