            <h2 id="overview" class="tb-title" style="margin-top:10px">Overview</h2>
            <p>The Serydina Isles rise from the Weeping Sea like the broken bones of a primordial giant—nine major
                islands shrouded in pearl-gray mists and bound by currents that change with a mind of their own.
                Foremost
                lies <strong>Snuuflund</strong>, crowned by <strong>Mount Solnyi Plach</strong> (“Salt Weeping”),
                a dormant volcano whose crater lake bleeds brine down its flanks in eerie crimson threads. The smaller
                isles lay close like mourners round a bier, each with its own coves, kelp forests, and ruin-snagged
                shoals.</p>
            <p>Life here is hardship braided with ceremony. The clans keep longships and lore in equal measure; grief is
                fermented into mead and sung into the <em>Saga of Sorrows</em>, an epic that lengthens each year. When
                the <strong>Althing of Depths</strong> meets in the <strong>Bone Mead-Hall</strong>—a parliament carved
                from the ribs of a titanic whale—judgment is rendered beneath bioluminescent kelp banners.
            </p>
            <p>Beneath the waves, whole <strong>forests of petrified longships</strong> stand in <strong>Utgård
                    Bay</strong>, where pilgrims dive for counsel from drowned jarls. Some who rise again speak in the
                language of whales for days.</p>
            <p>Outsiders arriving at the Serydina Isles must first undergo the Rite of Salt-Welcome at the harbor of
                Snuuflund, where they drink seawater mixed with spiced rum and speak their truest sorrow aloud before
                the assembled crowd. Those who refuse or lie find their ships becalmed, unable to leave until they offer
                genuine grief to the sea.</p>
            <p>Trade must be conducted through the Merchants' Mourning, where foreign goods can only be exchanged after
                sharing authentic tales of loss and regret. The Serydinki prize stories above gold, memories above
                silver, and will pay handsomely for accounts of distant tragedies.</p>

            <h3 class="tb-title">The Bone Mead-Hall</h3>
            <p>Carved from the ribcage of a titanic whale that beached itself in grief, this great hall serves as the
                primary meeting place for the Althing of Depths. The roof is formed from interlaced whale ribs, and
                bioluminescent kelp hangs like banners between the bone pillars. Here, the Serydinki gather to share the
                ritual mead brewed from fermented fish and recite the Saga of Sorrows—an epic poem that grows longer
                each year as new griefs are added to its verses.

            <p>Beneath thirty fathoms of black water lie the preserved hulls of the original Viking fleet that brought
                the Serydinki's ancestors to these shores. The salt water has turned the wood to stone, creating an
                underwater forest of petrified dragon-prowed vessels. Pilgrims dive to these depths seeking wisdom from
                the drowned jarls whose spirits still hold court in the flooded halls, though many who descend too deep
                return speaking only in the language of whales.

            <h3 class="tb-title">The Weeping Rune-Stones of Sorrow's Point</h3>
            <p>Standing stones carved with runic inscriptions that weep tears of liquid silver mark the northernmost tip
                of the main island. Each stone records a different aspect of the great catastrophe that drove the
                ancestors from their homeland, but the runes shift and change when viewed directly, showing each
                observer the particular grief that matches their own heart's wounds. Scholars who attempt to transcribe
                the runes find their notes dissolving into salt water before the ink can dry.

            <h3 class="tb-title">The Frost Giant&rsaquo;s cauldron</h3>
            <p>A massive tidal pool formed in the crater of an extinct volcano on the isle of Morid-Heart, this natural
                formation is said to be where the last frost giant wept himself to death watching his kin perish in the
                great thaw. The water never freezes despite the northern winds, and strange fish swim in its
                depths—creatures with human faces that mouth words in the old tongue. The Serydinki cast offerings of
                carved bone and braided hair into its waters, believing the giant's spirit can carry messages to the
                realm of the honoured dead.

            <p>Built from the fossilized bones of a fallen maiden, this lighthouse guides ships through the treacherous
                approaches to the main harbor. The beacon burns with corpse-light—a cold flame that provides no warmth
                but can be seen for leagues through even the thickest fog. The lighthouse keeper is always a volunteer
                who has lost their entire family to the sea, and they serve until death, tending the flame while
                composing death-songs for sailors lost in the surrounding waters.
