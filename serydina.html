            <h4 class="skz-viking">Politics</h4>
            <p>There is no single jarl or sea-king ruling the Serydina Isles, no unified throne carved from whalebone
                and coral. Instead, power flows through the Drowning Courts—councils of jarls who have ritually drowned
                and returned to speak for both the living and the sea-lost. Each major island maintains its own Thing,
                though they meet as the Althing of Depths only during the spring tide eclipses when the barriers between
                worlds grow thin and the drowned can vote alongside the living.</p>
            <p>The courts govern through dream-law and the reading of omens in salt patterns and whale songs. Justice
                flows like the tide—what is forbidden at high water may be permitted when the sea retreats. Disputes are
                settled through the Ordeal of Depths, where both accuser and accused must dive to the sunken longships
                of their ancestors and return with tokens from the drowned halls. Those who surface empty-handed face
                exile to one of the many barren and almost uninhabitable islands.</p>

            <h4 class="skz-viking">Population</h4>
            <P>The native Serydinki number perhaps six thousand souls scattered across the islands, descendants of the
                Sken who traversed the great western ocean from Skia. They are tall and lean with skin bearing a faint
                luminescence like moonlight on water, and eyes that hold depths mirroring the sea—gray-green and ancient
                beyond their years. Many still bear the ritual scars of their ancestors: runic marks carved with
                whalebone knives.</P>

            <p>The Serydina Isles rise from the Weeping Sea like the broken bones of some primordial giant, a scattered
                archipelago of nine major islands shrouded in pearl-gray mists. These islands became a realm where
                ancient longships rest in coral tombs and the descendants have learned to breathe sorrow like salt air.
                The largest isle, Snuuflund, is crowned by Mount Solnyi Plach (Salt Weeping)—a dormant volcano whose
                crater lake weeps brine that flows down the mountainsides in crimson streams.</p>
            <p>The smaller islands orbit this central mass like mourners around a corpse, connected by treacherous
                currents that shift with supernatural unpredictability. Here, the line between sea and sky blurs in
                eternal mists.</p>

            <h4 class="skz-viking">The Bone Mead-Hall of Jarl Grimheart</h4>
            <p>Carved from the ribcage of a titanic whale that beached itself in grief, this great hall serves as the
                primary meeting place for the Althing of Depths. The roof is formed from interlaced whale ribs, and
                bioluminescent kelp hangs like banners between the bone pillars. Here, the Serydinki gather to share the
                ritual mead brewed from fermented fish and recite the Saga of Sorrows—an epic poem that grows longer
                each year as new griefs are added to its verses.</p>
            <h4 class="skz-viking">The Sunken Longships of Utgård Bay</h4>
            <p>Beneath thirty fathoms of black water lie the preserved hulls of the original Viking fleet that brought
                the Serydinki's ancestors to these shores. The salt water has turned the wood to stone, creating an
                underwater forest of petrified dragon-prowed vessels. Pilgrims dive to these depths seeking wisdom from
                the drowned jarls whose spirits still hold court in the flooded halls, though many who descend too deep
                return speaking only in the language of whales.</p>
            <h4 class="skz-viking">The Weeping Rune-Stones of Sorrow's Point</h4>
            <p>Standing stones carved with runic inscriptions that weep tears of liquid silver mark the northernmost tip
                of the main island. Each stone records a different aspect of the great catastrophe that drove the
                ancestors from their homeland, but the runes shift and change when viewed directly, showing each
                observer the particular grief that matches their own heart's wounds. Scholars who attempt to transcribe
                the runes find their notes dissolving into salt water before the ink can dry.</p>

            <h2 class="skz-viking">Visiting the Serydina Isles</h2>
            <p>Outsiders arriving at the Serydina Isles must first undergo the Rite of Salt-Welcome at the harbor of
                Snuuflund, where they drink seawater mixed with spiced rum and speak their truest sorrow aloud before
                the assembled crowd. Those who refuse or lie find their ships becalmed, unable to leave until they offer
                genuine grief to the sea. </p>
            <p>Trade must be conducted through the Merchants' Mourning, where foreign goods can only be exchanged after
                sharing authentic tales of loss and regret. The Serydinki prize stories above gold, memories above
                silver, and will pay handsomely for accounts of distant tragedies. </p>

            <h4 class="skz-viking">The Frost-Giant's Cauldron</h4>
            <p>A massive tidal pool formed in the crater of an extinct volcano on the isle of Morid-Heart, this natural
                formation is said to be where the last frost giant wept himself to death watching his kin perish in the
                great thaw. The water never freezes despite the northern winds, and strange fish swim in its
                depths—creatures with human faces that mouth words in the old tongue. The Serydinki cast offerings of
                carved bone and braided hair into its waters, believing the giant's spirit can carry messages to the
                realm of the honoured dead.</p>
            <h4 class="skz-viking">The Corpse-Light Beacon of Maiden’s Rest</h4>
            <p>Built from the fossilized bones of a fallen maiden, this lighthouse guides ships through the treacherous
                approaches to the main harbor. The beacon burns with corpse-light—a cold flame that provides no warmth
                but can be seen for leagues through even the thickest fog. The lighthouse keeper is always a volunteer
                who has lost their entire family to the sea, and they serve until death, tending the flame while
                composing death-songs for sailors lost in the surrounding waters.</p>
