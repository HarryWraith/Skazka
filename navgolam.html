            <h4 class="skz-viking">Population</h4>
            <p>Some 12,000 stoneborn souls make their home in Nav’golam. These include the dwarf clans
                themselves—miners, smiths, gemcrafters—and a small retinue of subterranean beasts tamed for duty, such
                as the golden-horned cave goats that haul ore and the stalwart burrow-beetles that tunnel through rock.
                The city thrives on precise labor, shared feasting, and the steady rhythm of hammer against anvil.</p>
            <h4 class="skz-viking">Politics</h4>
            <p>Nav’golam is ruled by King Theldon, 5th of his line, with the guidance of a council Forge Lords, each
                representing one of the
                city’s principal clans. Decisions are forged in heated debate in the echoing Council Halls
                and bound by the ancient Pact of Firesmiths. Leadership passes by blood: but any king may be challenged
                to trial by combat.</p>

            <p>Far below the living world lies Nav’golam, a vast dwarven city hewn into the bones of the earth. Born in
                the year –1800, it stands as the first true home of wandering dwarven clans, a place they could call
                sanctuary after centuries in the Underworld. Here, stalactites and torchlight herald pillars of stone,
                and laughter echoes off endless halls. The name Nav’golam, “Stone’s Heart,” speaks of purpose: a
                fortress shaped by will and fire, founded when dwarves at last found a home under the mountain.</p>

            <h4 class="skz-viking">The Black Gate</h4>
            <p>A monolithic arch of iron-smelted stone marking the city's threshold—the first sight of Nav’golam’s
                immensity. Ancient runes etched in basalt whisper of ancestral strength to those who pass beneath.</p>

            <h4 class="skz-viking">The Great Forge</h4>
            <p>
                Within the heart of Nav’golam's Underworks, furnaces roar like underground suns. Here, the legendary
                Ember-Anvil stands—a living forge that glows with perpetual forge-fire, used only on the most sacred of
                creations.
            </p>

            <h4 class="skz-viking">Glowstone Canals</h4>
            <p>
                Narrow waterways lit by luminescent minerals. Small boats ferry ore and other goods through glowing
                tunnels—an
                eerie, dreamlike river of light carved from living rock.

            <h2 class="skz-viking">Visiting Nav'golam</h2>
            <p>Visitors arrive via the Spiral Shaft, a vast tunnel lit by luminous fungi and glowing ore veins. After
                emerging in the Grand Antechamber, guests pass through the Watch-Pillars and are welcomed by the
                Duty-Stewards. While dwarves are cautious of strangers, travelers who bring tales of distant lands—or
                rare metals—are shown hospitality in the Hearth of Passing. Still, delveers beware: contracts are
                binding in Nav’golam, enforced by oath and rune-stone.</p>

            <h4 class="skz-viking">The Vault of A Thousand Hammers</h4>
            <p>
                A deep subterranean archive where dwarves deposit records of guilds, treaties, and genealogies in
                gem-encrusted chests. The walls themselves are lined in copper leaf, reflecting torchlight like
                whispered
                memory.
            </p>

            <h4 class="skz-viking">Hall of Echoing Drums</h4>
            <p>
                A ceremonial chamber where resonant beats echo off cavern walls. It serves as a gathering point for
                festivals, ancestral remembrances, and when the Pact of Firesmiths is renewed, the drums speak for the
                earth
                itself.
            </p>

            <h4 class="skz-viking">The Subterranean Gardens</h4>
            <p>
                Hidden within basalt chambers are pockets of engineered soil, where hardy mushrooms, glowing lichen, and
                low-cropped root-veg are grown under torchlight—sustenance born of stone and ingenuity.
