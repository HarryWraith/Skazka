        <li><b>Crown of broken links</b>: A circlet made of snapped chain segments, signifying the weight of oppression
          and
          the wrath that follows when bonds are shattered.</li>
        <li><b>The stitched eyelid</b>: An eye sewn shut with black thread, emblem of curses that blind, bind, and
          silence —
          and of the world’s refusal to see the downtrodden.</li>
        <li><b>The ashen brand</b>: A ring of concentric scar-marks around a hollow center, like a burn that never
          heals;
          used as a curse-seal pressed into wax, skin, or stone.</li>

      <p>Mani was once a man broken by betrayal — some say Lunica’s betrayal, others say the world’s. He was marked,
        cast
        aside, left to die, but instead of death, the curses of the forsaken rose around him like a crown. He took
        them
        all
        upon himself — the hatred of the abandoned, the rage of the maimed, the despair of the downtrodden — and with
        them,
        he became something more than mortal. If Lunica ascended through the power of betrayal, Mani ascended through
        the
        agony of survival. He is the eternal victim turned eternal avenger.</p>

        <li>He is locked in eternal war with Lunica, not only because she betrayed him, but because every betrayal
          feeds
          his
          power.</li>
        <li>Those who suffer injustice or cruelty whisper prayers to Mani, believing that curses spoken in his name
          always
          find their mark.</li>
