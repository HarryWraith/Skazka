    <li><b>Crown of broken links</b>: A circlet made of snapped chain segments, signifying the weight of oppression and
      the wrath that follows when bonds are shattered.</li>
    <li><b>The stitched eyelid</b>: An eye sewn shut with black thread, emblem of curses that blind, bind, and silence —
      and of the world’s refusal to see the downtrodden.</li>
    <li><b>The ashen brand</b>: A ring of concentric scar-marks around a hollow center, like a burn that never heals;
      used as a curse-seal pressed into wax, skin, or stone.</li>

  <p>Mani was once a man broken by betrayal — some say Lunica’s betrayal, others say the world’s. He was marked, cast
    aside, left to die, but instead of death, the curses of the forsaken rose around him like a crown. He took them all
    upon himself — the hatred of the abandoned, the rage of the maimed, the despair of the downtrodden — and with them,
    he became something more than mortal. If Lunica ascended through the power of betrayal, Mani ascended through the
    agony of survival. He is the eternal victim turned eternal avenger.</p>

      grievances, offering their suffering as tribute.</li>

      devotion of the lowly to Mani’s endless hunger.</li>

      power.</li>

      find their mark.</li>
