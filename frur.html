      <!-- ===== Overview ===== -->
      <h2 id="overview" class="tb-title">Overview</h2>
      <p>Often referred to as the true successor to <a href="uzume.html">Uzume</a>, Frur is envisioned as the gentle yet
        potent Goddess of
        Fertility, caretaker of fields, flocks, and families. Enshrouded in robes woven from fresh blossoms and new
        spring shoots, she radiates a serene, nurturing presence — a living embodiment of growth and renewal.</p>

    <!-- ===== Influence
 ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="domains">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Influence</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cultivation & Harvest</strong>: Farmers invoke Frur before tilling, believing she bestows fertile
          soil and timely rains. In story, she whispers to the earth, coaxing sprouts from fields, or burbles in brooks
          to water parched lands.</li>
        <li><strong>Childbirth & Family</strong>: Midwives whisper prayers to Frur during labor. She stands sentry at
          newborn’s cradle, offering blessings of health and bounty. In folklore, a whispered chant—“Frur guide us, Frur
          protect” — is said to ease childbirth and inspire maternal strength.</li>
        <li><strong>Renewal & Rebirth</strong>: Legend holds that Frur visits hibernating animals, stirring them awake
          when spring is near. In the wild, flowers ahead of schedule are believed to signal her passing.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- ===== Symbols & Omens ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="symbols">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Symbols</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Crescent of Seeds</strong>: A diadem crafted from grain and poppy seeds, representing both nourishment
          and the potential of new life.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Twining Ivy Staff</strong>: Symbolic of life's interconnectedness, this staff sprouts new buds
          whenever
          fertility blooms nearby.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Aurora Cloak</strong>: A shimmering mantle reflecting Skazka's cycles — vibrant greens in spring,
          golden in harvest, muted in winter — mirroring seasonal growth.

    <!-- ===== Tenets ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="tenets">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Tenets</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Tend the seed and the season—cultivate, water, and share the harvest so life renews itself.
        </li>
        <li>Guard cradles and kin—aid childbirth, midwives, and the fragile beginnings of every lineage.</li>
        <li>Honour the turning year—accept winter’s rest and spring’s return, trusting renewal to follow.</li>

    </div>

    <!-- ===== Rites & Offerings ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="rites">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Rites</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Springward Dance:</strong> Every spring, maidens and farmers process to an ancient grove at
          dawn. They dance in circles, tossing flower-imbued seed-pouches into the earth — a ritual believed to awaken
          Frur’s blessing upon every ploughed furrow.</li>
        <li><strong>The Night of Blooming</strong>: Legends say that once a year on the longest night, Frur wanders
          through sleeping villages, leaving single flowers — daisies, poppies, violets — on doorsteps. Houses where a
          bloom appears are foretold a year of prosperity or new life.</li>
        <li><strong>The Coven of Green Shoots</strong>: In remote rural places, midwives and herbalists gather in Frur’s
          name, brewing teas made from herbs and spices to support healthy pregnancies. Their sacred circle is rung with
          ivy and wheat, echoing Frur’s staff — and believed to channel her spirit during delivery.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Avatars & Interventions ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="avatars">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Avatars</h2>
      <p>Frur sometimes “threads the mortal weave” as The Wayfarer-Mother—a barefoot, visibly pregnant woman walking the
        furrows at dusk, cloak smelling faintly of milk and crushed ivy; wherever her feet fall, rye lifts its heads and
        thistles turn their barbs outward. She appears when a hamlet’s harvest, hospitality, or midwifery is failing: to
        test generosity (who offers bread and a seat by the stove), to ward the unborn (her presence draws wolves and
        ill luck to herself and away from nearby cradles), and to re-seed tired fields (dew beads along her path and
        soil loosens like fresh-tilled loam). Signs include crickets falling silent in a widening ring, foxes pacing at
        her flanks without fear, and a shadow that always shows two figures—mother and child—no matter the moon. She
        never crosses a threshold uninvited; if welcomed, she knots a red thread to the lintel (safe delivery within the
        turning of a moon), and by dawn she’s gone, leaving only ivy buds on the door and a warm loaf no one baked. If
        refused, the fields lie heavy and silent for three mornings, until a neighbor breaks the bread they withheld.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Lore ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="lore">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Lore</h2>
      <p>When a family line is threatened—by famine, plague, or childlessness—they invoke Frur's protection through the
        Vigil of the Twining Ivy Staff. A solitary staff is crafted from ivy and grain, then set in the hearth’s center.
        For seven nights, the staff is tended and watered, and a story of family and future is spoken aloud beside it.
        On the seventh dawn, if the ivy has sprouted golden buds atop its green tendrils, it's seen as Frur’s promise of
        renewal: new births, returned prosperity, and a lineage rekindled.</p>
