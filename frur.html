            <p>Often referred to as the true successor to Uzume, Frur is
            envisioned as the gentle yet potent Goddess of Fertility, caretaker of fields, flocks, and families. Enshrouded in
            robes woven from fresh blossoms and new spring shoots, she radiates a serene, nurturing presence — a living
            embodiment of growth and renewal.</p>

             <h3>Rites</h3>
        <ul class="nodec">
          <li><b>The Springward Dance</b>: Every spring, maidens and farmers process to an ancient grove at dawn. They dance in
            circles, tossing flower-imbued seed-pouches into the earth — a ritual believed to awaken Frur’s blessing upon every
            ploughed furrow.</li>
          <li><b>The Night of Blooming</b>: Legends say that once a year on the longest night, Frur wanders through sleeping
            villages, leaving single flowers — daisies, poppies, violets — on doorsteps. Houses where a bloom appears are foretold
            a year of prosperity or new life.</li>
          <li><b>The Coven of Green Shoots</b>: In remote rural places, midwives and herbalists gather in Frur’s name, brewing
            teas made from herbs and spices  to support healthy pregnancies. Their sacred circle is rung with ivy and wheat, echoing
            Frur’s staff — and believed to channel her spirit during delivery.</li>

          <li><b>Cultivation & Harvest</b>: Farmers invoke Frur before tilling, believing she bestows fertile soil and timely rains.
            In story, she whispers to the earth, coaxing sprouts from fields, or burbles in brooks to water parched lands.</li>
          <li><b>Childbirth & Family</b>: Midwives whisper prayers to Frur during labor. She stands sentry at newborn’s cradle,
            offering blessings of health and bounty. In folklore, a whispered chant—“Frur guide us, Frur protect” — is said to
            ease childbirth and inspire maternal strength.</li>
          <li><b>Renewal & Rebirth</b>: Legend holds that Frur visits hibernating animals, stirring them awake when spring is near.
            In the wild, flowers ahead of schedule are believed to signal her passing.</li>

            <h3>Lore</h3>
            <ul class="nodec">
                <li>Each dawn, long before mortals rise, Frur unfolds her Aurora Cloak across the sky. When tears of longing glisten on its surface—tiny dew-like droplets—they are said to be the Weeping of the Aurora. Those rare tears fall as morning dew on freshly sown fields, irresistibly drawing seedlings upward and instilling them with vibrant life. Farmers believe that lands kissed by the Aurora's tears yield crops so lush, they whisper in the wind.</li>
                <li>Villagers speak of a humble peasant who, awakened by moonlight, found his fields aglow with closed moon-blossoms. Unaware of Frur’s wandering, he harvested seeds that yielded a forest of grain—grain that fed dozens for years. He whispered forever afterward: "Under the seed moon, Frur sowed her grace."</li>
                <li>When a family line is threatened—by famine, plague, or childlessness—they invoke Frur's protection through the Vigil of the Twining Ivy Staff. A solitary staff is crafted from ivy and grain, then set in the hearth’s center. For seven nights, the staff is tended and watered, and a story of family and future is spoken aloud beside it. On the seventh dawn, if the ivy has sprouted golden buds atop its green tendrils, it's seen as Frur’s promise of renewal: new births, returned prosperity, and a lineage rekindled.</li>
