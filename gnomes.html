            <h2 class="tb-title">Physical Description</h2>
            <p>While smaller in stature compared to most other races, Gnomes carry themselves with an energy and
                presence that often makes one forget their size. Their hands are deft and precise, well-suited to the
                detailed work of gem-cutting, clockwork engineering, and fine metalcraft. They often dress practically,
                their clothing chosen for flexibility and utility rather than ornament—though in true Gnomish fashion,
                even the simplest garments are likely to bear clever adjustments, hidden pockets, or ingenious
                fastenings. In many ways, their very appearance reflects their character: compact, efficient, and full
                of unexpected surprises.</p>

            <p>The Gnomes of Skazka are a people wrapped in mystery, their origins obscured in the mists of history.
                Unlike Elves, whose ancestry stretches clearly back to ancient lineages, or Dwarves, who can trace their
                roots to divine design, Gnomes seem to have simply appeared—a quiet people without fanfare, mythic
                event, or cosmic purpose. This lack of a definitive origin has become part of their identity, shaping
                them into a race defined less by destiny and more by ingenuity, adaptability, and a relentless drive to
                improve the world around them. Where others rely on tradition, brute strength, or divine blessing,
                Gnomes excel through innovation, subtle progress, and the quiet revolution of everyday invention.</p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Heritage</h2>
            <p>The debate over Gnomish heritage has raged for centuries. Dwarven historians often argue that Gnomes are
                their distant kin, an offshoot of their ancient bloodline that chose creativity over tradition, surface
                trade over underground forges. They point to shared skills in mining and craftsmanship as evidence of a
                common ancestor. Gnomes themselves, however, reject this claim. To them, the differences in philosophy
                are too great to ignore—where Dwarves are bound by tradition, Gnomes thrive in experimentation. This
                divide suggests that if there ever was a link, it has long since become irrelevant. What truly defines
                Gnomes is not where they came from, but the inventive spirit they cultivated on their own path.</p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Motivation</h2>
            <p>At the heart of every Gnome lies an insatiable curiosity and an unshakable desire to solve problems. To
                them, the world is not something to be endured, but a puzzle waiting for solutions. Their smiths design
                weapons and tools that adapt to conditions, their alchemists brew concoctions that make life safer and
                easier, and their engineers devise mechanisms that save lives in mines or make simple tasks more
                efficient. Gnomes are not driven by conquest, wealth, or glory—though these may come as side effects—but
                by the joy of discovery and the satisfaction of creating something that improves the lives of others.
                They embody the belief that progress need not come from sacrifice, but from dedication, creativity, and
                the clever application of knowledge.</p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Integration into Society</h2>
            <p>Gnomes fit seamlessly into the wider fabric of Skazkan society, though always in their own distinctive
                way. Their underground communities are masterworks of space management and clever engineering, thriving
                around natural resources and built with astonishing efficiency. Surface settlements, meanwhile, tend to
                appear in neglected corners of larger towns—areas too cramped or inconvenient for others, which Gnomes
                transform into vibrant districts filled with workshops, markets, and ingenious innovations. Their
                culture, unlike many others, values merit above bloodline, with guilds and workshops granting status
                based on skill and contribution rather than birthright. This meritocracy produces brilliant merchants,
                teachers, and craftsmen who spread their creations far and wide. Though peaceful by inclination, Gnomes
                are not defenseless; when threatened, their ingenuity turns to strategy, traps, and tactical warfare. In
                both war and peace, they prove that progress and survival alike rest on the same
                foundation—intelligence, creativity, and adaptability.</p>
