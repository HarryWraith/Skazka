            <h2 class="tb-title">Overview</h2>

            <p>
                The Gnomes of Skazka are a people wrapped in mystery,
                their origins obscured in the mists of history. Unlike
                <a href="elves.html">Elves</a>, whose ancestry
                stretches clearly back to ancient lineages, or
                <a href="dwarves.html">Dwarves</a>, who can trace their
                roots to divine design, Gnomes seem to have simply
                appeared — a quiet people without fanfare, mythic
                event, or cosmic purpose. This lack of a definitive
                origin has become part of their identity, shaping them
                into a race defined less by destiny and more by
                ingenuity, adaptability, and a relentless drive to
                improve the world around them. Where others rely on
                tradition, brute strength, or divine blessing, Gnomes
                excel through innovation, subtle progress, and the
                quiet revolution of everyday invention.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the heart of every Gnome lies an insatiable
                curiosity and an unshakable desire to solve problems.
                To them, the world is not something to be endured, but
                a puzzle waiting for solutions. Their smiths design
                weapons and tools that adapt to conditions, their
                alchemists brew concoctions that make life safer and
                easier, and their engineers devise mechanisms that save
                lives in mines or make simple tasks more efficient.
                Gnomes are not driven by conquest, wealth, or
                glory—though these may come as side effects—but by the
                joy of discovery and the satisfaction of creating
                something that improves the lives of others. They
                embody the belief that progress need not come from
                sacrifice, but from dedication, creativity, and the
                clever application of knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gnomes fit seamlessly into the wider fabric of Skazkan
                society, though always in their own distinctive way.
                Their underground communities are masterworks of space
                management and clever engineering, thriving around
                natural resources and built with astonishing
                efficiency. Surface settlements, meanwhile, tend to
                appear in neglected corners of larger towns—areas too
                cramped or inconvenient for others, which Gnomes
                transform into vibrant districts filled with workshops,
                markets, and ingenious innovations. Their culture,
                unlike many others, values merit above bloodline, with
                guilds and workshops granting status based on skill and
                contribution rather than birthright. This meritocracy
                produces brilliant merchants, teachers, and craftsmen
                who spread their creations far and wide. Though
                peaceful by inclination, Gnomes are not defenseless;
                when threatened, their ingenuity turns to strategy,
                traps, and tactical warfare. In both war and peace,
                they prove that progress and survival alike rest on the
                same foundation—intelligence, creativity, and
                adaptability.

        <article class="tb-panel" id="physiology">
            <h2 class="tb-title">Physiology & Traits</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Appearance:</strong> Gnomes are small,
                    sharp-eyed, and quick-fingered, with warm
                    earth-toned skin, lively features, wiry hair
                    (often with whiskers), and layered, pocketed
                    clothes stuffed with tools and trinkets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Dimorphism:</strong> In gnomes, sex
                    differences are clear to the eye: males are a
                    little taller with squarer shoulders, denser body
                    and facial hair, heavier brows, and deeper voices;
                    females are shorter on average with softer
                    features, fuller hips, finer body hair, and
                    lighter voices. The contrast reads in
                    silhouette—broad-torsoed, bearded tinkerers beside
                    round-hipped, sharp-eyed craftswomen—yet both
                    remain compact and quick-handed by nature.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Senses:</strong> Gnomes read the world in
                    fine print: dark and dim light bloom for them in
                    soft greys, and they catch the tiny sounds—gear
                    teeth kissing, a latch settling—that others miss.
                    Their noses sort oils, metal filings, and singed
                    varnish at a whiff, making a workshop speak like a
                    book.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Innate Gifts:</strong> Gnomes are born
                    with a mind that magic can’t easily fool—their
                    wits slip past charms and glamours as if through a
                    hidden service door. Many carry a flicker of knack
                    from their bloodline: forest gnomes idly weave
                    whispers and light into harmless illusions and
                    trade secrets with squirrels and sparrows, while
                    rock gnomes “remember” how things work—names of
                    compounds, quirks of old mechanisms—and can coax
                    clever little clockworks to life from springs,
                    wire, and patience. Small of stature but tireless
                    of curiosity, they turn ingenuity into a kind of
                    everyday sorcery: toys that walk, lanterns that
                    hum, and ideas that refuse to break.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Virtues & Laws:</strong> Gnomes prize
                    curiosity yoked to craft: precision, fair dealing,
                    and sharing useful discoveries once the work is
                    proven safe. Their laws read like workshop
                    rules—measure twice, mark your sources, honor
                    patents and apprenticeships, test before trade—and
                    fraud in tools or weights is treated as both a
                    crime and a disgrace.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Craft & Trade:</strong> Gnome craft is
                    precision with personality: clockworks that purr,
                    lenses true to the hair’s breadth, inks and resins
                    mixed like alchemy, and toys whose whimsy hides
                    serious engineering. Workshops run on
                    apprenticeships, maker’s marks, and warranty
                    oaths; every tool has a provenance, and
                    “right-to-repair” is sacred—diagrams are shared
                    once a design is proven safe. Trade favors
                    bustling tinkers’ markets and traveling factors
                    who barter prototypes, lease patents, and arrange
                    maintenance contracts. Exports include fine
                    instruments, springlocks, surveying kits, automata
                    novelties, and calibrated lenses; imports trend
                    toward rare alloys, crystal, volatile oils, and
                    hardwoods. Nothing is wasted: salvage rights are
                    codified, and scrap returns to the bench until it
                    sings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Family & Names:</strong> Gnome families
                    are busy, affectionate hives built around
                    workshops and shared projects: grandparents,
                    parents, apprentices, and foster-kin crowd the
                    same benches, passing tools and stories in equal
                    measure. Marriages are partnerships of invention
                    as much as romance—vows often sealed by
                    co-designed pieces—and children grow amid safe,
                    supervised tinkering, earning their first toolroll
                    when they can maintain it without prompting.
                    Kinship stretches by mentorship and patent-sharing
                    as readily as blood; it’s common to “adopt” a
                    promising apprentice into the household, and
                    elders keep meticulous family ledgers of designs,
                    failures, and lessons so each generation starts a
                    little further along the blueprint.

                    <strong>Customs & Rites:</strong> Gnome customs

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Patrons:</strong> Gnomes lean towards

                <li>
                    <strong>Origin Story:</strong> Gnomes say they
                    “woke to the sound of making”—the first to rise
                    after Starfall were small folk who followed a
                    steady, hidden ticking through the wreckage and
                    learned to coax order from broken things. In their
                    oldest tales, craft itself is their patron: not a
                    single god but the stubborn spark in gears, glass,
                    and ink that taught them to measure, mend, and
                    build a future from salvage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Rites & Taboos:</strong> Gnome rites
                    center on the Naming Gear, First Fix, Twin Keys
                    with a Calibration Vigil, and the Remembrance of
                    Hands—small ceremonies that bind craft to kin.
                    Their taboos are plain: never sell untested
                    prototypes, never falsify measures or maker’s
                    marks, don’t open another’s device without
                    Bench-Right, and waste nothing that can be safely
                    salvaged.

                Gnome folk tend to three broad lineages: forest gnomes,
                soft-voiced whisperers with a knack for small illusions
                and woodland bonds; rock gnomes, tireless tinkerers and

                (svirfneblin), flint-hard Underworld survivors famed
                for stealth, stone-sense, and grim practicality.

            <p>
                Forest gnomes are soft-footed whisperers of the
                green—small, moss-toned folk who weave harmless
                illusions like firefly lights and speak to squirrels
                and sparrows as neighbors. They keep to root-homes and
                hidden ladders in the boughs, trading in herbs, inks,
                and clever camouflages rather than steel.<span class="tag">Forest</span>

            <p>
                Rock gnomes are tireless bench-dwellers with magnifiers
                on cords and pockets full of spare springs—masters of
                fine instruments, sturdy clockworks, and inks that bite
                true. They prize repeatable design and cheerful
                iteration, trading calibrated lenses, survey kits, and
                clever automata that look like toys until they save a
                life.<span class="tag">Rock</span>

            <p>
                Deep gnomes (svirfneblin) are flint-hard Underworld
                survivors—ashen-skinned, soft-voiced, and
                near-invisible when they choose—whose stone-sense and
                stoic pragmatism keep them alive where light is a
                rumor. They trade in cut gems, salts, and precise
                stonecraft, trusting clever camouflage and quiet routes
                over banners or boasts.<span class="tag">svirfneblin</span>
