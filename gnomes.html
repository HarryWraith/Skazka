            <h2 class="tb-title">Overview</h2>

            <p>
                The Gnomes of Skazka are a people wrapped in mystery,
                their origins obscured in the mists of history. Unlike
                <a href="elves.html">Elves</a>, whose ancestry
                stretches clearly back to ancient lineages, or
                <a href="dwarves.html">Dwarves</a>, who can trace their
                roots to divine design, Gnomes seem to have simply
                appeared — a quiet people without fanfare, mythic
                event, or cosmic purpose. This lack of a definitive
                origin has become part of their identity, shaping them
                into a race defined less by destiny and more by
                ingenuity, adaptability, and a relentless drive to
                improve the world around them. Where others rely on
                tradition, brute strength, or divine blessing, Gnomes
                excel through innovation, subtle progress, and the
                quiet revolution of everyday invention.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the heart of every Gnome lies an insatiable
                curiosity and an unshakable desire to solve problems.
                To them, the world is not something to be endured, but
                a puzzle waiting for solutions. Their smiths design
                weapons and tools that adapt to conditions, their
                alchemists brew concoctions that make life safer and
                easier, and their engineers devise mechanisms that save
                lives in mines or make simple tasks more efficient.
                Gnomes are not driven by conquest, wealth, or
                glory—though these may come as side effects—but by the
                joy of discovery and the satisfaction of creating
                something that improves the lives of others. They
                embody the belief that progress need not come from
                sacrifice, but from dedication, creativity, and the
                clever application of knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gnomes fit seamlessly into the wider fabric of Skazkan
                society, though always in their own distinctive way.
                Their underground communities are masterworks of space
                management and clever engineering, thriving around
                natural resources and built with astonishing
                efficiency. Surface settlements, meanwhile, tend to
                appear in neglected corners of larger towns—areas too
                cramped or inconvenient for others, which Gnomes
                transform into vibrant districts filled with workshops,
                markets, and ingenious innovations. Their culture,
                unlike many others, values merit above bloodline, with
                guilds and workshops granting status based on skill and
                contribution rather than birthright. This meritocracy
                produces brilliant merchants, teachers, and craftsmen
                who spread their creations far and wide. Though
                peaceful by inclination, Gnomes are not defenseless;
                when threatened, their ingenuity turns to strategy,
                traps, and tactical warfare. In both war and peace,
                they prove that progress and survival alike rest on the
                same foundation—intelligence, creativity, and
                adaptability.

        <article class="tb-panel" id="physiology">
            <h2 class="tb-title">Physiology & Traits</h2>
            <p>Gnomes are small, sharp-eyed, and quick-fingered—warm earth-toned skin, lively features, wiry hair (often
                with whiskers), and pocketed layers crammed with tools and trinkets. Dimorphism reads clearly in
                silhouette: males a touch taller with squarer shoulders, heavier brows, deeper voices, and the fuller
                beards; females shorter on average with softer features, rounder hips, finer body hair, and lighter
                voices—yet both remain compact, deft, and restless with motion. Their senses live in the fine print: dim
                and darkness open into soft greys, tiny sounds—gear teeth kissing, a latch settling—pop to attention,
                and a keen nose sorts oils, filings, and singe so a workshop “speaks” like a book.</p>
            <p>Their gifts are nimble rather than grand. Gnomish wits slip past charms and glamours as through a service
                door, and most carry a bloodline knack: forest gnomes weave whispers and light into harmless illusions
                and gossip with sparrows and squirrels; rock gnomes seem to “remember” how things work—compounds,
                tolerances, old mechanism quirks—and can coax clever clockworks from springs and wire. Small in frame
                but tireless in curiosity, they turn ingenuity into everyday sorcery: toys that walk, lanterns that hum,
                and ideas that refuse to break.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="tb-panel" id="culture">
            <h2 class="tb-title">Culture & Society</h2>
            <p>Gnome society runs like a beloved workshop: curious, precise, and fair. Virtue means curiosity yoked to
                craft—measure twice, cite your sources, test before trade, honor patents and apprenticeships—and fraud
                in tools or weights is both crime and disgrace. Their making is precision with personality: clockworks
                that purr, hair-true lenses, inks and resins mixed like alchemy, and toys whose whimsy hides serious
                engineering. Maker’s marks, warranty oaths, and a sacred right-to-repair keep designs honest; once a
                device is proven safe, diagrams circulate. Trade hums through tinkers’ markets and traveling factors who
                barter prototypes, lease patents, and ink maintenance contracts. Exports: instruments, springlocks,
                surveying kits, automata novelties, calibrated lenses. Imports: rare alloys, crystal, volatile oils,
                fine hardwoods. Salvage rights are codified; scrap sings again after one more pass on the bench.</p>
            <p>Families are affectionate hives built around shared projects—grandparents, parents, apprentices, and
                foster-kin crowd the same benches, passing tools and stories alike. Marriages are partnerships of
                invention as much as romance, often sealed with co-designed pieces; promising apprentices are readily
                “adopted,” and elders maintain meticulous ledgers of designs, failures, and lessons so each generation
                starts farther along the blueprint. Work becomes ceremony: newborns receive a tiny Naming Gear, youths
                earn their First Fix, and marriages trade Twin Keys in a locking rite that symbolizes trust, access, and
                mutual responsibility.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="tb-panel" id="faith">
            <h2 class="tb-title">Faith & Myth</h2>
            <p>Gnome faith is practical and warmly irreverent: they lean toward Herukan (maker’s fire, bold invention)
                and sometimes Ioun (patient knowledge), but their oldest stories insist that craft itself is the true
                patron—the stubborn spark in gears, glass, and ink that taught small folk after Starfall to measure,
                mend, and build a future from salvage. They say they “woke to the sound of making,” following a hidden
                ticking through wreckage until order answered their hands.</p>
            <p>Rites are small, binding craft to kin: the Naming Gear for newborns, a youth’s First Fix, marriages
                sealed by Twin Keys and a Calibration Vigil, and the Remembrance of Hands for the honored dead. Taboos
                are plain and policed: never sell untested prototypes, never falsify measures or maker’s marks, don’t
                open another’s device without Bench-Right, and waste nothing that can be safely salvaged. Festivals are
                bright and useful: Tinker’s Moon with lantern parades and clockwork pageants, and Founders’ Day when
                benches open for public lessons and free repairs—piety expressed as tools that work and promises kept.

                Gnome folk tend to three broad lineages: forest gnomes,
                soft-voiced whisperers with a knack for small illusions
                and woodland bonds; rock gnomes, tireless tinkerers and
                keepers of clever clockworks; and deep gnomes
                (svirfneblin), flint-hard Underworld survivors famed
                for stealth, stone-sense, and grim practicality.

                Forest gnomes are soft-footed whisperers of the
                green—small, moss-toned folk who weave harmless
                illusions like firefly lights and speak to squirrels
                and sparrows as neighbors. They keep to root-homes and
                hidden ladders in the boughs, trading in herbs, inks,
                and clever camouflages rather than steel.<span class="tag">Forest</span>

                Rock gnomes are tireless bench-dwellers with magnifiers

                fine instruments, sturdy clockworks, and inks that bite

                iteration, trading calibrated lenses, survey kits, and
                clever automata that look like toys until they save a
                life.<span class="tag">Rock</span>

                Deep gnomes (svirfneblin) are flint-hard Underworld
                survivors—ashen-skinned, soft-voiced, and
                near-invisible when they choose—whose stone-sense and
                stoic pragmatism keep them alive where light is a
                rumor. They trade in cut gems, salts, and precise
                stonecraft, trusting clever camouflage and quiet routes
