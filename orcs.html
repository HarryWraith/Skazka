            <h2 class="tb-title">Physical Description</h2>
            <p>While the provided histories focus more on culture than appearance, Orcs carry the physical legacy of
                their creation as soldiers. Their frames are built for endurance and strength, making them imposing
                figures in both tribal and urban settings. Their physicality, honed for survival in hostile worlds and
                endless battlefields, often fuels the reputation that they are brutish or violent. Yet this same form is
                equally suited to guardianship, labor, and resilience, reflecting a people shaped for struggle but
                capable of adapting to new roles when necessity demands.</p>

            <p>The Orcs are a people whose very existence is defined by their origins as weapons of war. Unlike the
                other races of Skazka, who evolved or emerged naturally within its borders, the Orcs were deliberately
                created by the dark god Chernobog to serve as soldiers in battles beyond this world. Once the great wars
                ended and their god’s cause was concluded, they found themselves stranded on a dying world beneath a
                fading sun. In a rare moment of divine mercy, Chernobog transported the remnants of his warriors to
                Skazka, offering them refuge in recognition of their devotion and service. Though they were born for
                battle, their arrival in Skazka marked the beginning of an uncertain future—a new chapter where their
                purpose had to be redefined.</p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Heritage</h2>
            <p>The Orcish heritage is steeped in oral tradition, sectiontained by their storytellers, the Saga-Keepers.
                Through spoken history, they preserve the memory of their dying homeworld and the cosmic battles that
                defined their earliest existence. These tales are not only acts of remembrance but also of identity:
                they acknowledge the sacrifices of those who fell in wars not of their choosing and remind every
                generation that survival is itself a victory. Their stories speak of impossible battlefields—cities
                adrift on molten seas, wars waged in the light of dying stars—and of Chernobog himself, not as a distant
                god, but as a commanding presence who once walked among them. This heritage, rooted in both mythic
                grandeur and hard-won survival, resections the foundation of their cultural identity.</p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Motivation</h2>
            <p>For Orcs, survival and endurance are the greatest victories. Their culture values loyalty over
                convenience, strength tempered by adaptability, and perseverance in the face of overwhelming odds.
                Having witnessed the collapse of a world and the death of its sun, Orcs carry with them a profound
                understanding of impermanence. This perspective fuels their drive to find meaning in new forms of
                existence, whether as tribal guardians defending their chosen lands or as urban settlers striving for
                acceptance in foreign societies. Their desires are not limited to conquest or bloodshed; rather, they
                yearn for purpose, whether that means safeguarding their people, honoring their heritage, or proving
                their worth in the eyes of others.</p>

        <div class="tb-panel">
            <h2 class="tb-title">Integration into Society</h2>
            <p>Orcs exist in Skazka as both tribal warriors and urban settlers, each path reflecting different
                approaches to survival. Tribal Orcs live in scattered groups across remote regions, where their
                territorial instincts can be channeled into protecting rather than conquering land. Their
                societies
                sectiontain military hierarchies, but in practice, they often act as guardians of wilderness
                frontiers,
                deterring monsters and encroachment alike. Outsiders may misinterpret their directness and
                comfort with
                violence as savagery, but within their own culture, these traits are tempered by discipline and
                an
                understanding of defense rather than needless aggression.</p>
            <p>At the same time, a minority of Orcs choose to leave their tribes and integrate into cities,
                despite
                facing deep-seated prejudice. These urban Orcs find employment in roles that allow them to
                contribute
                while drawing on their natural strengths—guards, builders, guides, and protectors of trade
                routes. For
                them, integration is not abandonment of heritage but a conscious adaptation to ensure their
                people’s
                survival in a changing world. While they endure mistrust and discrimination, they view these
                struggles
                as another battle, one to be met with persistence instead of violence. In doing so, they slowly
                reshape
                perceptions, demonstrating that Orcs can be more than soldiers—that they can build, protect, and
                live
                alongside others without losing their essence.</p>
