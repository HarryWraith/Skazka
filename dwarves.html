            <h2 class="tb-title">Overview</h2>

            <p>The Dwarves are among the oldest mortal peoples to walk the lands of Skazka, forged in the deep places
                where mountains root themselves in streams of molten metal. Once servants of the gods, they were
                metalsmiths, miners, and artisans of unparalleled skill, their craft so fine it shaped the very tools
                with which creation was reshaped. Yet, for all their glory and devotion, their early history is steeped
                in betrayal, servitude, and rebellion. From those trials arose a people whose spirit burns with the fire
                of freedom, whose loyalty is as unyielding as stone, and whose legacy is carved into the bones of the
                earth itself.</p>
            <p>At the heart of the Dwarven spirit lies an unshakable desire for freedom and self-determination. Their
                lives are driven by the memory of betrayal, and every hammer strike, every vein of ore mined, and every
                work of art forged becomes a declaration of independence. They value loyalty above riches, for they know
                how costly betrayal can be, and they place friendship and honor higher than life itself. Wrath comes
                easily to them when faced with treachery, but so too does fierce devotion to those who earn their trust.
                Their contests of strength, love of gambling, and endless drive to create reflect a worldview shaped by
                hardship but not defeated by it. For the Dwarves, life is both a wager and a forge—each moment a chance
                to shape destiny anew.</p>
            <p>In the world of Skazka, Dwarves stand as a people apart yet indispensable. Their cities, particularly
                <a href="navgolam.html">Nav’Golam</a>, are bastions of stability and strength in the perilous depths,
                attracting trade, alliances,
                and respect. Though mistrustful of gods and those who embody deceit, Dwarves are legendary allies to
                mortals and nations who prove themselves worthy. Their loyalty is enduring, their word ironclad, and
                their bonds stronger than steel. While their hatred for Lolth and her kind ensures eternal conflict in
                the Underworld, on the surface and beyond, their reputation as smiths, warriors, and steadfast
                companions makes them a cornerstone of wider civilization. Wherever they dwell, they integrate through
                labor, craft, and unflinching honor, carving their place not through conquest but through the enduring
                weight of their character.

    <section class="grid-even equal-cards" id="pillars">
        <article class="tb-panel" id="physiology">
            <h2 class="tb-title">Physiology & Traits</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Compact and powerfully built, dwarves stand around 4½ feet tall with
                    dense muscle, barrel chests, and thick forearms and calves built for toil and battle; their faces
                    are square-jawed, noses blunt, and eyes set deep like coals in a hearth. Hair grows coarse and
                    abundant—beards (for most adults, regardless of sex in many clans) are a point of pride, braided
                    with clasps, beads, and metal rings that signal lineage or guild. </li>
                <li><strong>Dimorphism:</strong> Among dwarves, the line between male and female is a quiet seam rather
                    than a cleft: both are compact and iron-boned, broad across shoulder and hip, built to haul stone
                    and hardship alike. The differences show in whispers — males a thumb taller on average, voices like
                    gravel in a deep pan, brows a shade heavier; females a touch more enduring in cold tunnels, a
                    steadier fire that burns long into the watch. Beards are a custom as much as a birthright: most men
                    wear them proudly, some women too.</li>
                <li><strong>Senses:</strong> Dwarven senses are practical and hard-earned rather than mystical: eyes
                    adapted to dim spaces read texture and shadow well, catching hairline cracks, fine tool marks, and
                    slight color shifts in ore.</li>
                <li><strong>Innate Gifts:</strong> Born with the mountain in their marrow, dwarves carry quiet miracles:
                    a stone-binding knack that lets them read load, fault, and age from a wall’s chill; a forge-hard
                    constitution that shrugs off poison, stale air, and fever like sparks off an anvil; and a steadfast
                    will that knots oaths so tightly even sorcery struggles to pry them loose. Their feet “hear”—a
                    subtle ground-sense that feels tremors and footfalls through timber and rock—while their hands keep
                    true heat: they can judge temper and brittleness by touch alone. </li>
            </ul>
        </article>

        <article class="tb-panel" id="culture">
            <h2 class="tb-title">Culture & Society</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Virtues & Laws:</strong> Dwarven virtue is measured in what endures: an oath kept, a tool
                    well-made, a shift finished without complaint. Their law is carved in stone—plain words, few
                    loopholes—yet carried with a craftsman’s pragmatism.</li>
                <li><strong>Craft & Trade:</strong> Once smiths to the gods, dwarves still run their forges like temples
                    to that contract. Ledgers keep the old clauses—oath-steel must not fail, measures must be true, and
                    no sworn pattern is sold without release — so each workshop stamps a clan-mark beside a contract
                    rune.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Family & Names:</strong> Dwarven family is a tight braid of blood, clan, and guild. Children
                    grow at the hearth-circle, then apprentice early to a craft aunt or uncle; adoption by deed counts
                    as birth. </li>
                <li><strong>Customs & Rites:</strong> Dwarven life is counted in oaths and anvils. Hearth-Presentation
                    marks a newborn with soot and a ledger entry; at coming of age, Beard-Binding or Ring-Braiding and a
                    signed Craft-Oath bind the apprentice to a guild. </li>
            </ul>
        </article>

        <article class="tb-panel" id="faith">
            <h2 class="tb-title">Faith & Myth</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Patrons:</strong> Dwarven patronage begins at the tomb-wall, not the altar. Halls honor
                    ancestral masters — the smith who solved a stubborn alloy, the delver who mapped a deadly seam—by
                    keeping their tools oiled, their maxims posted above the bench, and their names rung before first
                    strike. </li>
                <li><strong>Origin Story:</strong> In the first winters of the world, when mountains were still cooling,
                    the high powers drafted a great Contract and from the bedrock raised a people to be their makers:
                    dwarves, tempered from ore-veins and fault-lines, sworn to forge the tools that would shape
                    creation. For ages they worked by clause and measure, learning the secrets of star-iron and true
                    temper, until the Contract’s gilding showed its teeth and service hardened into bondage. </li>
                <li><strong>Rites & Taboos:</strong> Rites among dwarves are work-born: the First
                    Fire each morning rekindles banked coals and rings the names of masters; Steel & Ink seals any
                    contract with a tap on the anvil; the Stonewake tolls nine
                    strikes for the dead.</li>
                <li><strong>Omens & Festivals:</strong> Dwarves are a deeply suspicious lot; a hammer’s first strike
                    that sings clear and long—good luck; a dull thud warns of hidden flaw or a coal brightening after
                    the bellows stop—an ancestor approves.</li>

            <p>Dwarven kind is one people tempered by many stones, their clans diverging where work and mountain shaped
                them: Mountain halls keep the old law and weight of ancestry; Deep delvers prize caution and
                fault-reading where rock sweats; sun-browned Hill folk braid trade roads to the underhalls; soot-flecked
                Emberborn chase the perfect alloy at roaring forges; the stern Greybound (duergar) hold to hard bargains
                and deed-first honor; and airy Rift spanwrights string bridges across chasms, measuring worth by the
                steadiness of a step. All share the ledger and the anvil, but each reads the mountain in a different

                the Spider Queen, renewed in seasons of fear and ambition; many bear living silk sigils rather than
                scars. They do not call it bondage but contract. Lean, spare, and vigilant, they prize
                deed-before-display only insofar as it tightens the web, rebuilding stature through impeccable craft and
                binding terms layered with web-clauses. Their taboos invert the mountain’s: never break a clause once
                spun; never grant a gift without leverage; never leave an agreement without a catch. Trust is earned one
                precise snare at a time; mercy is measured, and their fairness is absolute to the letter, not the

            <h3 class="tb-title">Stonewake</h3>
            <p>Stonewake is the year’s grave-quiet rite: at dusk the hall banks its forges, names of the dead are read
                from the ledger, and the anvil is struck nine times so the mountain “remembers.” Each ancestor’s tool is
                brought from its wall-niche, oiled, and set briefly to work by the heir who bears their craft
                line—echoing the hand—then returned with a fresh scrap of cloth and a notch marked in the ledger.
                Quarrels pause, guest-right widens, and fines are forgiven if restitution is made before the ninth
                strike; only truth is spoken on Stonewake, and only the worthy are named, so that the living feel the
                weight they must carry without cracking.</p>

            <img src="assets/unbinding.jpg" alt="Oathmark" class="noborder">
            <h3 class="tb-title">Unbinding</h3>
            <p>Unbinding is the vow hammered into freedom: at Chainquench, red-hot links of old chain are plunged into
                snow troughs with a hiss like dying serpents, then drawn to the anvil and reforged into door-bands and
                oath-rings—iron that once held a dwarf now bars danger and binds only by consent. The rite recalls the
                loophole that broke the god-contract, so contracts today are sealed under Steel & Ink with the same
                care, and a notch is cut beside the clan mark to show the work serves the work, not the wielder. By
                taboo, no link quenched in Unbinding may ever be shaped back into fetter or collar; to do so would call
                the mountain’s memory against you.</p>

            <img src="assets/duergar.jpg" alt="Stormsail" class="noborder">
            <h3 class="tb-title">Duergar</h3>
            <p>The duergar—Greybound to the halls above—still serve Lolth, their oaths knotted in living silk and signed
                in blood-ink clauses only spiders fully read. Lean, silent, and surgical in their craft, they prize
                results over reputation and weave web-clauses into every contract: leverage, favors, silence—nothing is
                free, everything is binding. Their forges burn low and cold to keep secrets; tools carry eight-point
                stamps and hair-thin barbs, beautiful and cruel. Ancestral niches hold reliquaries wrapped in spider
                silk; apprentices swear to “spin true” before a brazier of chitin and iron. Taboos invert the
                mountain’s: mercy without terms is folly, guest-right ends at the threshold, and a tool taken may be
                kept if the contract was weak. To outsiders they are impeccably polite and predatory; to Lolth they are
                the hammer-hand of the web, remaking dwarven craft into instruments of patience, entrapment, and
                exquisite inevitability.

            <h3 class="tb-title">Beards not compulsory</h3>
            <p>Not all female dwarves grow beards, and among those who do, not all choose to wear them. Beard growth
                varies by bloodline and region—common in mountain and emberborn clans, rarer among hill and rift
                folk—and hormones, age, and craft stresses (forge heat, ore dust) can thicken or thin growth over a
                lifetime. Culture makes the rest: some women keep full braids as a mark of lineage; others shave for
                visor fit, workshop safety, or simple preference; many who don’t beard at all ring-braid their head hair
                with the same clan tokens used in beards. Status isn’t tied to facial hair but to oath and workmanship:
                a clean-chinned master with a ledger of flawless proofs is honored as readily as a matriarch whose beard
                bears five generations of rings.</p>
