            <h2 class="tb-title">Overview</h2>

            <p>The Dwarves are among the oldest mortal peoples to walk the lands of Skazka, forged in the deep places
                where mountains root themselves in streams of molten metal. Once servants of the gods, they were
                metalsmiths, miners, and artisans of unparalleled skill, their craft so fine it shaped the very tools
                with which creation was reshaped. Yet, for all their glory and devotion, their early history is steeped
                in betrayal, servitude, and rebellion. From those trials arose a people whose spirit burns with the fire
                of freedom, whose loyalty is as unyielding as stone, and whose legacy is carved into the bones of the
                earth itself.</p>
            <p>At the heart of the Dwarven spirit lies an unshakable desire for freedom and self-determination. Their
                lives are driven by the memory of betrayal, and every hammer strike, every vein of ore mined, and every
                work of art forged becomes a declaration of independence. They value loyalty above riches, for they know
                how costly betrayal can be, and they place friendship and honor higher than life itself. Wrath comes
                easily to them when faced with treachery, but so too does fierce devotion to those who earn their trust.
                Their contests of strength, love of gambling, and endless drive to create reflect a worldview shaped by
                hardship but not defeated by it. For the Dwarves, life is both a wager and a forge—each moment a chance
                to shape destiny anew.</p>
            <p>In the world of Skazka, Dwarves stand as a people apart yet indispensable. Their cities, particularly
                <a href="navgolam.html">Nav’Golam</a>, are bastions of stability and strength in the perilous depths,
                attracting trade, alliances,
                and respect. Though mistrustful of gods and those who embody deceit, Dwarves are legendary allies to
                mortals and nations who prove themselves worthy. Their loyalty is enduring, their word ironclad, and
                their bonds stronger than steel. While their hatred for Lolth and her kind ensures eternal conflict in
                the Underworld, on the surface and beyond, their reputation as smiths, warriors, and steadfast
                companions makes them a cornerstone of wider civilization. Wherever they dwell, they integrate through
                labor, craft, and unflinching honor, carving their place not through conquest but through the enduring
                weight of their character.

        <article class="tb-panel" id="physiology">
            <h2 class="tb-title">Physiology & Traits</h2>
            <p>Dwarves are compact powerhouses—about four and a half feet tall, barrel-chested, iron-boned, with thick
                forearms and calves built for toil and battle. Faces run square and blunt, eyes set deep like coals;
                hair grows coarse and abundant, and beards are a point of pride for most adults (men certainly, many
                women too), braided with beads, clasps, and rings that declare lineage or guild. Dimorphism is a quiet
                seam rather than a cleft: males trend a thumb taller with heavier brows and gravel-deep voices; females
                carry a steadier fire and often outlast in cold tunnels. Their sight is made for dim spaces—reading
                texture and shadow, hairline cracks and tool marks, and the faint color shifts that tell good ore from
                bad.</p>
            <p>Born with mountain in the marrow, dwarves keep a handful of quiet miracles. They “stone-bind,” reading
                load, fault, and age from a wall’s chill; their forge-hard constitutions shrug off poison, stale air,
                and fever like sparks off an anvil; and their oaths knot so tightly that even sorcery strains to pry
                them loose. Feet “hear” through timber and rock—the tremor of carts, the rhythm of pick and
                footfall—while their hands know true heat, judging temper and brittleness by touch alone. None of it is
                flashy; it’s the kind of steadiness that holds a roof, mends a breach, and gets a people home.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="tb-panel" id="culture">
            <h2 class="tb-title">Culture & Society</h2>
            <p>Dwarven society measures worth by what endures: an oath kept, a tool that holds its edge, a shift
                finished without complaint. Law is literal—plain words carved in stone, few loopholes—yet enforced with
                a craftsperson’s pragmatism: fix what you broke, pay what you owe, and don’t promise what you can’t
                deliver. Markets are orderly and loud with hammers; ledgers sit beside altars, because contracts are
                half scripture, half shop-talk.</p>
            <p>Their forges still feel like temples to the old god-bargains. Oath-steel must not fail, measures must be
                true, and no sworn pattern is sold without release; every workshop stamps a clan-mark beside a contract
                rune. Family is a tight braid of blood, clan, and guild: children are raised at the hearth-circle,
                apprenticed early to a craft aunt or uncle, and adoption by deed counts as birth. Life is tallied in
                rites—Hearth-Presentation (soot and a ledger entry), Beard-Binding or Ring-Braiding at coming of age,
                and a signed Craft-Oath that binds apprentice to guild—each vow another ring in the timber of a life
                meant to last.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="tb-panel" id="faith">
            <h2 class="tb-title">Faith & Myth</h2>
            <p>Dwarven faith starts at the tomb-wall, not the altar. Halls honor ancestral masters—the smith who solved
                a stubborn alloy, the delver who mapped a deadly seam—by keeping their tools oiled, their maxims posted
                above the bench, and their names rung before first strike. In their oldest myth, when mountains still
                cooled, the high powers drafted a great Contract and raised a people from bedrock to be makers: dwarves,
                tempered from ore-veins and fault-lines to forge the tools of creation. They labored by clause and
                measure, learning star-iron and true temper, until the Contract’s gilding showed its teeth and service
                hardened into bondage—a lesson engraved in every ledger: know the terms you swear, and who they serve.
            </p>
            <p>Rites are work-born. First Fire rekindles the coals each morning as the masters’ names are rung; Steel &
                Ink seals a pact with a tap on the anvil; Stonewake tolls nine slow strikes for the dead. They read
                omens like craftsmen: a hammer’s first blow that sings clear and long—good luck; a dull thud warns
                hidden flaw; a coal that brightens after the bellows stop—an ancestor’s approval. Festivals are loud
                with anvils and ledgers, reverent not to distant gods but to the craft that keeps halls standing and
                debts paid.</p>

            <p>Dwarven kind is one people tempered by many stones, their clans diverging where work and mountain shaped

                fault-reading where rock sweats; sun-browned Hill folk braid trade roads to the underhalls; soot-flecked
                Emberborn chase the perfect alloy at roaring forges; the stern Greybound (duergar) hold to hard bargains
                and deed-first honor; and airy Rift spanwrights string bridges across chasms, measuring worth by the
                steadiness of a step. All share the ledger and the anvil, but each reads the mountain in a different

                the Spider Queen, renewed in seasons of fear and ambition; many bear living silk sigils rather than
                scars. They do not call it bondage but contract. Lean, spare, and vigilant, they prize
                deed-before-display only insofar as it tightens the web, rebuilding stature through impeccable craft and
                binding terms layered with web-clauses. Their taboos invert the mountain’s: never break a clause once
                spun; never grant a gift without leverage; never leave an agreement without a catch. Trust is earned one
                precise snare at a time; mercy is measured, and their fairness is absolute to the letter, not the

            <p>Stonewake is the year’s grave-quiet rite: at dusk the hall banks its forges, names of the dead are read
                from the ledger, and the anvil is struck nine times so the mountain “remembers.” Each ancestor’s tool is
                brought from its wall-niche, oiled, and set briefly to work by the heir who bears their craft
                line—echoing the hand—then returned with a fresh scrap of cloth and a notch marked in the ledger.
                Quarrels pause, guest-right widens, and fines are forgiven if restitution is made before the ninth
                strike; only truth is spoken on Stonewake, and only the worthy are named, so that the living feel the
                weight they must carry without cracking.</p>

            <h3 class="tb-title">Unbinding</h3>
            <p>Unbinding is the vow hammered into freedom: at Chainquench, red-hot links of old chain are plunged into
                snow troughs with a hiss like dying serpents, then drawn to the anvil and reforged into door-bands and
                oath-rings—iron that once held a dwarf now bars danger and binds only by consent. The rite recalls the
                loophole that broke the god-contract, so contracts today are sealed under Steel & Ink with the same
                care, and a notch is cut beside the clan mark to show the work serves the work, not the wielder. By
                taboo, no link quenched in Unbinding may ever be shaped back into fetter or collar; to do so would call
                the mountain’s memory against you.</p>

            <h3 class="tb-title">Duergar</h3>
            <p>The duergar—Greybound to the halls above—still serve Lolth, their oaths knotted in living silk and signed
                in blood-ink clauses only spiders fully read. Lean, silent, and surgical in their craft, they prize
                results over reputation and weave web-clauses into every contract: leverage, favors, silence—nothing is
                free, everything is binding. Their forges burn low and cold to keep secrets; tools carry eight-point
                stamps and hair-thin barbs, beautiful and cruel. Ancestral niches hold reliquaries wrapped in spider
                silk; apprentices swear to “spin true” before a brazier of chitin and iron. Taboos invert the
                mountain’s: mercy without terms is folly, guest-right ends at the threshold, and a tool taken may be
                kept if the contract was weak. To outsiders they are impeccably polite and predatory; to Lolth they are
                the hammer-hand of the web, remaking dwarven craft into instruments of patience, entrapment, and
                exquisite inevitability.

            <h3 class="tb-title">Beards not compulsory</h3>
            <p>Not all female dwarves grow beards, and among those who do, not all choose to wear them. Beard growth
                varies by bloodline and region—common in mountain and emberborn clans, rarer among hill and rift
                folk—and hormones, age, and craft stresses (forge heat, ore dust) can thicken or thin growth over a
                lifetime. Culture makes the rest: some women keep full braids as a mark of lineage; others shave for
                visor fit, workshop safety, or simple preference; many who don’t beard at all ring-braid their head hair
                with the same clan tokens used in beards. Status isn’t tied to facial hair but to oath and workmanship:
                a clean-chinned master with a ledger of flawless proofs is honored as readily as a matriarch whose beard
                bears five generations of rings.</p>
