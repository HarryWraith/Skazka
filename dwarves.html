            <h4 class="skz-viking">Physical Description</h4>
            <p>Though their lore speaks most loudly of their deeds and character, the Dwarves’ very bodies reflect the
                resilience of their kind. Stocky and strong, they are built to endure the crushing weight of the world
                above them and the unforgiving environments of the Underworld. Their arms are corded with the strength
                of generations spent at forges and mines, and their hands are roughened from centuries of work with
                hammer and pick. Every line on their faces carries the weight of endurance, determination, and the
                fierce joy they find in both labor and revelry. Their physical presence is as solid and unyielding as
                the mountains they inhabit, a living testament to their bond with stone and fire.</p>

            <p>The Dwarves are among the oldest mortal peoples to walk the lands of Skazka, forged in the deep places
                where mountains root themselves in streams of molten metal. Once servants of the gods, they were
                metalsmiths, miners, and artisans of unparalleled skill, their craft so fine it shaped the very tools
                with which creation was reshaped. Yet, for all their glory and devotion, their early history is steeped
                in betrayal, servitude, and rebellion. From those trials arose a people whose spirit burns with the fire
                of freedom, whose loyalty is as unyielding as stone, and whose legacy is carved into the bones of the
                earth itself.</p>

            <h4 class="skz-viking">Heritage</h4>
            <p>The story of the Dwarves begins with divine service. They were bound by a bargain with Jutus, the
                messenger of the gods, to labor for millennia in exchange for a kingdom of their own. When the promised
                city of Kitezh was granted, they found the gift tainted—freedom had not been part of the bargain.
                Betrayed but not broken, the Dwarves rebelled, turning their mastery of craft into weapons of war. They
                raised Kitezh from its roots and defied the gods, but true freedom came only with the founding of
                Nav’Golam, a city wholly their own, wrought entirely by Dwarven hands. This heritage of bondage,
                betrayal, and triumph has etched itself into their very soul, shaping them into a people for whom
                independence is sacred and whose civilization stands as a monument to perseverance.</p>

            <h2 class="skz-viking">Motivation</h2>
            <p>At the heart of the Dwarven spirit lies an unshakable desire for freedom and self-determination. Their
                lives are driven by the memory of betrayal, and every hammer strike, every vein of ore mined, and every
                work of art forged becomes a declaration of independence. They value loyalty above riches, for they know
                how costly betrayal can be, and they place friendship and honor higher than life itself. Wrath comes
                easily to them when faced with treachery, but so too does fierce devotion to those who earn their trust.
                Their contests of strength, love of gambling, and endless drive to create reflect a worldview shaped by
                hardship but not defeated by it. For the Dwarves, life is both a wager and a forge—each moment a chance
                to shape destiny anew.</p>
            <h2 class="skz-viking">Integration into Society</h2>
            <p>In the world of Skazka, Dwarves stand as a people apart yet indispensable. Their cities, particularly
                Nav’Golam, are bastions of stability and strength in the perilous depths, attracting trade, alliances,
                and respect. Though mistrustful of gods and those who embody deceit, Dwarves are legendary allies to
                mortals and nations who prove themselves worthy. Their loyalty is enduring, their word ironclad, and
                their bonds stronger than steel. While their hatred for Lolth and her kind ensures eternal conflict in
                the Underworld, on the surface and beyond, their reputation as smiths, warriors, and steadfast
                companions makes them a cornerstone of wider civilization. Wherever they dwell, they integrate through
                labor, craft, and unflinching honor, carving their place not through conquest but through the enduring
                weight of their character.</p>
