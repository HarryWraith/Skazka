            <h2 class="tb-title">Overview</h2>

            <p>The Dragonborn are enigmatic beings whispered to be the offspring of dragons and <a
                    href="humans.html">humans</a>, their existence a defiance of the natural order of Skazka. They did
                not walk the cursed realms until after Starfall—the cataclysmic night when the heavens bled secrets into
                the world and the ancient wyrms stirred from their timeless slumber. Whether they are strangers to this
                land or children born from its wounded magic, their sudden emergence is tied irrevocably to that event.
                To this day, their origin remains cloaked in mystery, with scholars and Dragonborn alike struggling to
                unravel the truth of their creation.</p>

            <p>More than most races, the Dragonborn are driven by a hunger for understanding. They seek answers to their
                own existence, desperate to uncover whether they are accidents of magic, chosen harbingers of change, or
                the beginning of something greater. This pursuit shapes their lives, compelling them into study,
                exploration, and conflict in equal measure. Yet beyond this, their desires often reflect their dual
                nature: some embrace the wanderlust and power of their draconic progenitors, while others seek belonging
                and purpose among mortals. Their existence is both a question and a promise, and in their striving they
                embody the tension between destiny and choice.</p>
            <p>Despite their strange origins and often fearsome appearance, Dragonborn have found acceptance across much
                of Skazka. In a land where survival demands strength and alliances, their intelligence, resilience, and
                raw power make them valued companions rather than outcasts. Among kobold tribes, Dragonborn are revered
                as living gods, seen as the pinnacle of what their kind might one day become. Entire clans devote
                themselves to Dragonborn champions, believing service and bravery will earn them ascension into draconic
                form.</p>
            <p>In human settlements, Dragonborn often rise to roles of authority or wisdom, their heritage lending them
                gravitas in matters of ancient knowledge and arcane lore. Yet, unlike most races, they have never forged
                a kingdom or empire of their own. Their blood seems to carry a nomadic instinct, driving them to wander,
                integrate, and enrich other cultures rather than build one unique to themselves. The only exception lies
                in the northern town of <a href="winter.html">Winter</a>, where the greatest number of Dragonborn
                gather, drawn by some unseen force. There, they serve as guardians of the harsh mountain settlement,
                embodying both protectors of mortals and keepers of their own mysterious traditions.</p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Physiology & Traits</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Broad-shouldered and tower-tall, dragonborn are covered in small,
                    interlocking scales coloured and patterned depending on their heritage. Horns or crests frame the
                    skull, with slit-pupiled
                    eyes that catch torchlight like molten coin. </li>
                <li><strong>Dimorphism:</strong> Dragonborn dimorphism is subtle but real: females tend to be a touch
                    taller with longer, swept crests and finer brow ridges; males are broader across chest and wrists,
                    with thicker horn rings and heavier jaw plates. </li>
                <li><strong>Senses:</strong> Dragonborn eyes are built for dusk: broad slit pupils drink light.</li>
                <li><strong>Innate Gifts:</strong> Each dragonborn carries a spark of their forebear’s element—fire,
                    frost, storm, acid, or venom—and can pour it from their lungs in a sudden gout or cutting line of
                    breath. Their scales shrug the same harm they wield.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Virtues & Laws:</strong> Dragonborn uphold honor above all: speak truth, keep oaths, repay
                    debts, and face foes openly.</li>
                <li><strong>Craft & Trade:</strong> Dragonborn crafts favor heat and precision: breath-forged steel,
                    scaled leathers, kiln-fired ceramics, and gemwork cut to razor tolerances. Haggling is expected,
                    deceit is taboo, and a broken trade-oath stains a clan more deeply than rust.</li>
                <li><strong>Family & Names:</strong> Dragonborn families are clan-first and oath-bound, built from
                    blood, oath-siblings, and honored elders who guide each clutch to discipline and craft. </li>
                <li><strong>Customs & Rites:</strong> Emberfast names the hatchlings over live coals, each kin gifting a
                    measured breath to harden resolve. </li>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Faith & Myth</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Patrons:</strong> Dragonborn faith stays clan-first, Gods second.</li>
                <li><strong>Origin Story:</strong> After Starfall, when the dragons roused from ages of slumber, the
                    dragonborn appeared — absent from all prior records and chronicles. Whether wrought by the wyrms’
                    waking will, quickened from long-sleeping eggs, or born of Starfall’s ash and omen is disputed; all
                    agree their first footprints begin in that dawn.</li>
                <li><strong>Rites & Taboos:</strong> promises are sealed with a pinch of salt. When someone dies, their
                    kin cremate the body and
                    fuse a thumb of ash into glass for the clan wall.</li>
                <li><strong>Omens & Festivals:</strong> Emberfall marks the turning into long night: streets hung with
                    red glass, braziers lit from a single traveling coal, and every doorway chalked to welcome strangers
                    in from the cold.</li>

            <p>In Skazka, dragonborn lineages show in the cast of their scales and the “flavor” of their breath—reds,
                whites, greens, blues, bronzes, and subtler blends besides—each a quiet echo of the wyrms who woke after
                Starfall. Clans read these hues the way others read sigils: not as destiny, but as a lean of temperament
                and tradition. Over generations the colors braid, yielding new shades and habits, yet the old tones
                linger at the throat and along the brow, a courteous nod to the subspecies from which a lineage first
                took its fire.</p>
