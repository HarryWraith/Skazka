        <article class="tb-panel" id="overview">
            <h2 class="tb-title">Overview</h2>

            <p>The Dragonborn are enigmatic beings whispered to be the offspring of dragons and <a
                    href="humans.html">humans</a>, their existence a defiance of the natural order of Skazka. They did
                not walk the cursed realms until after Starfall—the cataclysmic night when the heavens bled secrets into
                the world and the ancient wyrms stirred from their timeless slumber. Whether they are strangers to this
                land or children born from its wounded magic, their sudden emergence is tied irrevocably to that event.
                To this day, their origin remains cloaked in mystery, with scholars and Dragonborn alike struggling to
                unravel the truth of their creation.</p>

            <p>More than most races, the Dragonborn are driven by a hunger for understanding. They seek answers to their
                own existence, desperate to uncover whether they are accidents of magic, chosen harbingers of change, or
                the beginning of something greater. This pursuit shapes their lives, compelling them into study,
                exploration, and conflict in equal measure. Yet beyond this, their desires often reflect their dual
                nature: some embrace the wanderlust and power of their draconic progenitors, while others seek belonging
                and purpose among mortals. Their existence is both a question and a promise, and in their striving they
                embody the tension between destiny and choice.</p>
            <p>Despite their strange origins and often fearsome appearance, Dragonborn have found acceptance across much
                of Skazka. In a land where survival demands strength and alliances, their intelligence, resilience, and
                raw power make them valued companions rather than outcasts. Among kobold tribes, Dragonborn are revered
                as living gods, seen as the pinnacle of what their kind might one day become. Entire clans devote
                themselves to Dragonborn champions, believing service and bravery will earn them ascension into draconic
                form.</p>
            <p>In human settlements, Dragonborn often rise to roles of authority or wisdom, their heritage lending them
                gravitas in matters of ancient knowledge and arcane lore. Yet, unlike most races, they have never forged
                a kingdom or empire of their own. Their blood seems to carry a nomadic instinct, driving them to wander,
                integrate, and enrich other cultures rather than build one unique to themselves. The only exception lies
                in the northern town of <a href="winter.html">Winter</a>, where the greatest number of Dragonborn
                gather, drawn by some unseen force. There, they serve as guardians of the harsh mountain settlement,
                embodying both protectors of mortals and keepers of their own mysterious traditions.</p>

    <!-- PHYSIOLOGY / CULTURE / FAITH -->
    <section class="grid-even equal-cards" id="pillars">
        <article class="tb-panel" id="physiology">
            <h2 class="tb-title">Physiology & Traits</h2>
            <p>Dragonborn are rangy and tower-tall, all broad shoulders and interlocking scales that ripple in colors
                tied to their ancestry. Horns or sweeping crests frame a blunt, regal skull; slit pupils drink
                torchlight like molten coin. Dimorphism is present but restrained: females tend to run a touch taller
                with longer, swept crests and finer brow ridges; males are broader through chest and wrists, with
                thicker horn rings and heavier jaw plates. Their eyes favor dusk—edges stay clear when shadows
                lengthen—so they move confidently in failing light even as colors mute.</p>
            <p>In the marrow sits the true inheritance: a caged element—fire, frost, storm, acid, or venom—that a
                dragonborn can loose in a sudden breath, cone or cutting line depending on lineage. The same birthright
                hardens them against that harm: fire-kin shrug cinders, frost-kin the bite of cold, and so on. Scales
                thicken along impact lines, claws are serviceable tools, and lungs run big to fuel both roar and breath.
                None of it is decorative; their physiology is a working treaty between mortal frame and draconic spark,
                built to endure, to announce itself, and—when pressed—to exhale the ancestry that named them.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="tb-panel" id="culture">
            <h2 class="tb-title">Culture & Society</h2>
            <p>Dragonborn culture is oath-bright and face-forward: honor first, then everything else. Truth is spoken
                plainly, debts are counted and repaid, and enemies are met in the open—no skulking, no clever lies that
                curdle a name. Clans carry law like a banner; a broken trade-oath stains a household deeper than rust.
                Markets run hot with argument but not deceit—haggling is a duel of pride and craft, not a license to
                cheat.</p>
            <p>Their making matches their temper: breath-forged steel, scaled leathers stitched to withstand heat,
                kiln-fired ceramics tempered to song, and gemwork cut to razor tolerances. Families are clan-first and
                oath-bound, weaving blood, oath-siblings, and honored elders into a disciplined lattice that raises each
                clutch to purpose. Rites burn steady: at Emberfast, hatchlings are named over live coals while kin lend
                a measured breath, tempering resolve the way a blade takes heat—so that when the world tests them, they
                ring true.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="tb-panel" id="faith">
            <h2 class="tb-title">Faith & Myth</h2>
            <p>Dragonborn piety runs clan-first, gods second. Oaths are the true sacrament: a promise is sealed with a
                pinch of salt so the tongue remembers its weight, and lies are said to sour the mouth for a season.
                Their origin myths begin at Starfall: when the elder wyrms woke from ages of sleep, the dragonborn
                appeared with them—some say wrought by draconic will, others quickened from long-buried eggs, others
                born from ash and omen. However told, every clan sets its first footprints in that dawn and treats the
                drakes as elder kin whose breath still shapes fate.</p>
            <p>Rites burn clean and visible. The dead are cremated, their kin fusing a thumb of ash into glass for the
                clan wall so memory hardens like cooled flame. Emberfall, the turn into long night, strings streets with
                red glass and lights braziers from a single traveling coal; doorways are chalked to welcome strangers
                from the cold, a vow that heat and shelter outrank feud. Omens favor the elemental—cracked glass, a coal
                that won’t catch, a salt pinch that clumps—each read as the gods’ quiet grammar reminding the clan to
                stand straight under witness.</p>

            <p>In Skazka, dragonborn lineages show in the cast of their scales and the “flavor” of their breath—reds,
                whites, greens, blues, bronzes, and subtler blends besides—each a quiet echo of the wyrms who woke after
                Starfall. Clans read these hues the way others read sigils: not as destiny, but as a lean of temperament
                and tradition. Over generations the colors braid, yielding new shades and habits, yet the old tones
                linger at the throat and along the brow, a courteous nod to the subspecies from which a lineage first
                took its fire.</p>
