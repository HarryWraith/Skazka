            <h3>Physical Description</h3>
            <p>Every Dragonborn is a living testament to their draconic heritage, their scales shimmering across a spectrum as vast as shadow and light. Some shine with the purity of untouched snow, while others are as dark as a starless night. Between these extremes lie countless hues—the deep green of hidden forest pools, the burning red of fresh blood, the golden glow of dying sunlight, and the pale silver of starlight reflected on still waters. Their markings are no less striking, draconic patterns etched across their bodies like natural tattoos. These unique speckles, streaks, or spots are said to reveal lineage, and in some cases, destiny itself.</p>
            <p>Their physical traits vary widely, reflecting the diversity of dragonkind. Some display regal frills crowning their heads, delicate membranes that glow faintly in darkness, while others are adorned with cruel horns, barbed spines, and silhouettes that command fear as much as respect. Yet it is their eyes that betray their true nature—burning with inner fire, whether as the icy gleam of winter stars or the warm radiance of a hearth flame. In every gaze lies the undeniable presence of draconic power bound within mortal flesh.</p>

            <p>The Dragonborn are enigmatic beings whispered to be the offspring of dragons and mortals, their existence a defiance of the natural order of Skazka. They did not walk the cursed realms until after Starfall—the cataclysmic night when the heavens bled secrets into the world and the ancient wyrms stirred from their timeless slumber. Whether they are strangers to this land or children born from its wounded magic, their sudden emergence is tied irrevocably to that event. To this day, their origin remains cloaked in mystery, with scholars and Dragonborn alike struggling to unravel the truth of their creation.</p>

            <h3>Heritage</h3>
            <p>The heritage of the Dragonborn is as fractured and uncertain as the event that birthed them. Some believe Starfall tore open rifts between realms, allowing these hybrids to slip into Skazka from distant planes. Others whisper that the catastrophe awakened magic long dormant in the land, igniting dragon blood buried deep in the soil and reshaping it into living beings. Whatever the truth, the Dragonborn themselves bear the heaviest burden of this mystery, for within them burns the unanswered question of who—or what—they truly are.</p>

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>More than most races, the Dragonborn are driven by a hunger for understanding. They seek answers to their own existence, desperate to uncover whether they are accidents of magic, chosen harbingers of change, or the beginning of something greater. This pursuit shapes their lives, compelling them into study, exploration, and conflict in equal measure. Yet beyond this, their desires often reflect their dual nature: some embrace the wanderlust and power of their draconic progenitors, while others seek belonging and purpose among mortals. Their existence is both a question and a promise, and in their striving they embody the tension between destiny and choice.</p>
            <h2>Integration into Society</h2>
            <p>Despite their strange origins and often fearsome appearance, Dragonborn have found acceptance across much of Skazka. In a land where survival demands strength and alliances, their intelligence, resilience, and raw power make them valued companions rather than outcasts. Among kobold tribes, Dragonborn are revered as living gods, seen as the pinnacle of what their kind might one day become. Entire clans devote themselves to Dragonborn champions, believing service and bravery will earn them ascension into draconic form.</p>
            <p>In human settlements, Dragonborn often rise to roles of authority or wisdom, their heritage lending them gravitas in matters of ancient knowledge and arcane lore. Yet, unlike most races, they have never forged a kingdom or empire of their own. Their blood seems to carry a nomadic instinct, driving them to wander, integrate, and enrich other cultures rather than build one unique to themselves. The only exception lies in the northern town of Winter, where the greatest number of Dragonborn gather, drawn by some unseen force. There, they serve as guardians of the harsh mountain settlement, embodying both protectors of mortals and keepers of their own mysterious traditions.</p>
