            <h2 class="tb-title">Physical Description</h2>
            <p>Every Dragonborn is a living testament to their draconic heritage, their scales shimmering across a
                spectrum as vast as shadow and light. Some shine with the purity of untouched snow, while others are as
                dark as a starless night. Between these extremes lie countless hues—the deep green of hidden forest
                pools, the burning red of fresh blood, the golden glow of dying sunlight, and the pale silver of
                starlight reflected on still waters. Their markings are no less striking, draconic patterns etched
                across their bodies like natural tattoos. These unique speckles, streaks, or spots are said to reveal
                lineage, and in some cases, destiny itself.</p>
            <p>Their physical traits vary widely, reflecting the diversity of dragonkind. Some display regal frills
                crowning their heads, delicate membranes that glow faintly in darkness, while others are adorned with
                cruel horns, barbed spines, and silhouettes that command fear as much as respect. Yet it is their eyes
                that betray their true nature—burning with inner fire, whether as the icy gleam of winter stars or the
                warm radiance of a hearth flame. In every gaze lies the undeniable presence of draconic power bound
                within mortal flesh.</p>

            <p>The Dragonborn are enigmatic beings whispered to be the offspring of dragons and mortals, their
                existence
                a defiance of the natural order of Skazka. They did not walk the cursed realms until after
                Starfall—the
                cataclysmic night when the heavens bled secrets into the world and the ancient wyrms stirred from
                their
                timeless slumber. Whether they are strangers to this land or children born from its wounded magic,
                their
                sudden emergence is tied irrevocably to that event. To this day, their origin remains cloaked in
                mystery, with scholars and Dragonborn alike struggling to unravel the truth of their creation.</p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Heritage</h2>
            <p>The heritage of the Dragonborn is as fractured and uncertain as the event that birthed them. Some
                believe
                Starfall tore open rifts between realms, allowing these hybrids to slip into Skazka from distant
                planes.
                Others whisper that the catastrophe awakened magic long dormant in the land, igniting dragon
                blood
                buried deep in the soil and reshaping it into living beings. Whatever the truth, the Dragonborn
                themselves bear the heaviest burden of this mystery, for within them burns the unanswered
                question of
                who—or what—they truly are.</p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Motivation</h2>
            <p>More than most races, the Dragonborn are driven by a hunger for understanding. They seek answers to their
                own existence, desperate to uncover whether they are accidents of magic, chosen harbingers of change, or
                the beginning of something greater. This pursuit shapes their lives, compelling them into study,
                exploration, and conflict in equal measure. Yet beyond this, their desires often reflect their dual
                nature: some embrace the wanderlust and power of their draconic progenitors, while others seek belonging
                and purpose among mortals. Their existence is both a question and a promise, and in their striving they
                embody the tension between destiny and choice.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tb-panel">
            <h2 class="tb-title">Integration into Society</h2>
            <p>Despite their strange origins and often fearsome appearance, Dragonborn have found acceptance across much
                of Skazka. In a land where survival demands strength and alliances, their intelligence, resilience, and
                raw power make them valued companions rather than outcasts. Among kobold tribes, Dragonborn are revered
                as living gods, seen as the pinnacle of what their kind might one day become. Entire clans devote
                themselves to Dragonborn champions, believing service and bravery will earn them ascension into draconic
                form.</p>
            <p>In human settlements, Dragonborn often rise to roles of authority or wisdom, their heritage lending them
                gravitas in matters of ancient knowledge and arcane lore. Yet, unlike most races, they have never forged
                a kingdom or empire of their own. Their blood seems to carry a nomadic instinct, driving them to wander,
                integrate, and enrich other cultures rather than build one unique to themselves. The only exception lies
                in the northern town of Winter, where the greatest number of Dragonborn gather, drawn by some unseen
                force. There, they serve as guardians of the harsh mountain settlement, embodying both protectors of
                mortals and keepers of their own mysterious traditions.</p>
