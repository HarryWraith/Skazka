            <p>They walk among ruins and riches, memories and myths — gods who were once human. The Prir, known as the
                Walking Gods, are not born divine but become divine. Some ascended through great deeds or deep wisdom.
                Others stumbled into godhood by sheer chance, cruel fate, or cosmic whim. A few were elevated as reward,
                others as punishment. The universe, it seems, has a sense of humor.</p>
            <p>No two Prir are alike. Some are benevolent protectors, lighting the way for their followers. Others are
                unpredictable, vengeful, or wholly indifferent to mortal concerns. Some still whisper to their
                worshipers, guide kings, or stir the wind over battlefields. Others have vanished into silence, lost in
                their own eternity.</p>
            <p>Yet all share one truth: their power is not infinite. It ebbs and flows with the devotion of those who
                believe. Worship is the lifeblood of a Prir. Shrines, prayers, songs, and sacrifices feed their essence.
                A forgotten god is a fading god. A beloved one burns like a star.</p>
            <p>To understand the Prir is to understand the heights and failings of mortal existence itself — magnified,
                eternal, and walking still.</p>
