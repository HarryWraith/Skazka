            <p>They walk among ruins and riches, memories and myths — gods who were once human. The Prir, known as
                the
                Walking Gods,
                are not born divine but become divine. Some ascended through great deeds or deep wisdom. Others
                stumbled
                into
                godhood by sheer chance, cruel fate, or cosmic whim. A few were elevated as reward, others as
                punishment. The
                universe, it seems, has a sense of humor.</p>
            <p>No two Prir are alike. Some are benevolent protectors, lighting the way for their followers. Others
                are
                unpredictable, vengeful, or wholly indifferent to mortal concerns. Some still whisper to their
                worshipers,
                guide
                kings, or stir the wind over battlefields. Others have vanished into silence, lost in their own
                eternity.</p>
            <p>Yet all share one truth: their power is not infinite. It ebbs and flows with the devotion of those
                who
                believe.
                Worship is the lifeblood of a Prir. Shrines, prayers, songs, and sacrifices feed their essence. A
                forgotten
                god is a
                fading god. A beloved one burns like a star.</p>
            <p>To understand the Prir is to understand the heights and failings of mortal existence itself —
                magnified,
                eternal, and walking
                still.
            </p>
