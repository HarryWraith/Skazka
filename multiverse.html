                <p>Skazka lies upon the Prime Material plane, a realm shadowed by twin moons that wheel through its
                    night
                    skies like watchful sentinels. Lunica, the smaller of the two, glows a pale, ghostly white, while
                    Mani
                    looms larger, a sickly green orb that chills the marrow of those who gaze upon it. Their
                    significance
                    shifts with the eyes that behold them: <a href="dwarves.html">dwarves</a> curse their light,
                    muttering of misfortune and ill
                    portents, while certain <a href="beastraces.html">Beast Races</a> kneel in reverent worship, calling
                    them gods. The Aeternian
                    Calendar, the measure of all mortal time in Skazka, bends to their inexorable movements, marking the
                    passage of fate itself.</p>
                <p>Skazka is strange even among the stars. Over countless centuries, beings foreign to its lands have
                    appeared without warning, their origins cloaked in mystery. Scholars long puzzled over these
                    intrusions,
                    but it was only during the era of the Magical Prohibition that attention turned to their cause. They
                    discovered a perilous truth: Skazka’s borders with other realms are fragile, threadbare in places.
                    Here,
                    the substance of worlds thins, torn by unseen forces. These rifts—whispered of in dread tones as
                    ‘The
                    Veil’—open fleetingly, allowing passage to creatures and horrors from beyond, and leaving the land
                    ever
                    more haunted by the shadows of other realities.</p>

                <p>
                    Skazka sits where the multiverse thins: the Veil is fragile here, and in many places threadbare.
                    Some realms press closer than others—most of all the Shadow Realm, forever within arm’s reach. From
                    that near-dark, rifts are sometimes forced open by something—or someone—beyond the Veil. These
                    Incursions tear into Skazka without warning, and they almost never herald peace: raids, hauntings,
                    and other calamities spill through until the breach destabilises and shuts.

                <p>
                    This was a time of great turmoil when agents of Kaos sought to recover
                    the Shards of Uzume from Skazka. While those agents numbered few, they
                    possessed the ability to open rifts to other realms and call forth
                    servants of Kaos. After the Shadow War the Aeterian Empire banned the
                    study and practice of trans-dimensional travel, because it feared the
                    consequences such meddling may have on the world.

                <h3 class="tb-title">Starfall</h3>
                <p>Centuries ago, Skazka was structure by a shower of meteors, triggering a cataclysmic event known as
                    the
                    Starfall. The impact plunged the world into a mini ice age, reshaping lands, civilizations, and
                    trade
                    routes. Ancient dragons awoke from long slumber, reclaiming their dominion, while a new humanoid
                    race — the <a href="dragonborn.html">Dragonborn</a> - emerged, carrying the essence of dragons into
                    the mortal realm.</p>
                <p>
                    Skazka still wears the wounds of Starfall: dragons cut the skies, Dragonborn walk among mortals, and
                    the heavens’ shatter seeded the world with tiny “Tears of Uzume”—spark-bright gems whose stray
                    divinity can rouse simple enchantments into artifacts of legend.
