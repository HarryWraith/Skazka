            <h1 class="skz-viking">Skazka in the multiverse</h1>
            <p>Skazka lies upon the Prime Material plane, a realm shadowed by twin moons that wheel through its night
                skies like watchful sentinels. Lunica, the smaller of the two, glows a pale, ghostly white, while Mani
                looms larger, a sickly green orb that chills the marrow of those who gaze upon it. Their significance
                shifts with the eyes that behold them: dwarves curse their light, muttering of misfortune and ill
                portents, while certain Beast Races kneel in reverent worship, calling them gods. The Aeternian
                Calendar, the measure of all mortal time in Skazka, bends to their inexorable movements, marking the
                passage of fate itself.</p>
            <p>Skazka is strange even among the stars. Over countless centuries, beings foreign to its lands have
                appeared without warning, their origins cloaked in mystery. Scholars long puzzled over these intrusions,
                but it was only during the era of the Magical Prohibition that attention turned to their cause. They
                discovered a perilous truth: Skazka’s borders with other realms are fragile, threadbare in places. Here,
                the substance of worlds thins, torn by unseen forces. These rifts—whispered of in dread tones as ‘The
                Veil’—open fleetingly, allowing passage to creatures and horrors from beyond, and leaving the land ever
                more haunted by the shadows of other realities.</p>

            <h2 class="skz-viking">The Veil</h2>
            <p>
                Skazka is positioned in the multiverse in such a way that the barrier
                between it and other realms of existence is more fragile than on other
                worlds. This barrier is known as the veil. Consequently, Skazka
                frequently has visitors from other realms - some even make their home
                here.

            <h2 class="skz-viking">The shadow war</h2>
            <p>
                This was a time of great turmoil when agents of Kaos sought to recover
                the Shards of Uzume from Skazka. While those agents numbered few, they
                possessed the ability to open rifts to other realms and call forth
                servants of Kaos. After the Shadow War the Aeterian Empire banned the
                study and practice of trans-dimensional travel, because it feared the
                consequences such meddling may have on the world.

            <h2 class="skz-viking">Starfall</h2>
            <p>PCenturies ago, a mysterious star collided with Skazka, triggering a cataclysmic event known as the
                Starfall. The impact plunged the world into a mini ice age, reshaping lands, civilizations, and trade
                routes. Ancient dragons awoke from long slumber, reclaiming their dominion, while a new humanoid
                race—the Dragonborn—emerged, carrying the essence of dragons into the mortal realm.</p>
            <p>PThe Starfall also severed direct divine influence. Priests and devotees found their prayers unanswered,
                forcing the gods to act through their most faithful followers. Today, the land still bears scars of the
                celestial collision, dragons roam the skies, and the Dragonborn walk among mortals—reminders of a cosmic
                event that forever changed Skazka’s fate.</p>
