            <h4 class="skz-viking">Origins</h4>
            <p>Established deep within mountain folds, Kitezh was crafted from grey granite and revered for its
                masterful works—vaulted halls, carved effigies, and runic architecture.</p>

            <h4 class="skz-viking">Decline</h4>
            <p>Beneath the weight of their contract to be the smiths of the gods the dwarves endured&mdash;until they
                rose up. Their wrath consumed large parts of the city; but some of it remains intact.</p>
            <p>The city's end was abrupt and brutal. The dwarves were kept in check by their own kind; dwarves known as
                duergar (betrayers) and a garrison of Kua Toa. Once the legions of dwarves had put their mind to revolt
                it was all but over.</p>

            <p>Once the heart of a powerful necromantic sect, the Ruins of Orishan lie amid the shifting dunes of
                formerly fertile Kaijistan, on the banks of a long-dry river bed. As a living city, Orishan stood proud
                in the Kingdom of Kaijistan; now, its skeleton stands half-buried in wind-blown sand, a grim warning to
                those who dare to enter.</p>

            <p>Though many adventurers have attempted to carve their names into its crumbling stone, few return — and
                those who do tell hushed tales of whispers in the corridors and undead shadows moving beneath the moon.

            <ol class="toc-list">
                <li>
                    Frequent rockslides may entomb unwary explorers forever.
                    Cursed runic wards might trigger—snuffing out torches, triggering tremors, or animating stone
                    fragments.
                    Lingering Slave Chains: Some explorers claim to have seen spectral chains dragging across the
                    rubble,
                    echoing the bondage once suffered by the dwarves. Touching them leaves bruises that never fade.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Echoes of the Rebellion: Whispers of battle still ring through the halls — the clash of hammers, the
                    cries of revolt. Those who linger too long may suddenly find themselves surrounded by ghostly scenes
                    of
                    the uprising. Few return after witnessing them.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Unstable Tunnels: The dwarves collapsed many passages during the rebellion. The mountain remains
                    treacherous — walls crumble, ceilings groan, and entire corridors can vanish under sudden
                    rockslides.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Stone That Watches: Statues of dwarves line the ruins. Some are broken, others eerily intact.
                    Travelers
                    swear their eyes follow intruders, and in rare cases the statues move to block paths or crush
                    trespassers.
                </li>

                <li>
                    The Curse of the Ashes: Local folklore insists that breathing the dust of Kitezh dooms the lungs —
                    many
                    who leave the ruins are struck by a slow suffocation, as though the mountain still chokes them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Treasure of Betrayal: A rumour persists of a hidden vault containing weapons forged before the
                    uprising.
                    Every expedition that has sought them has ended in disaster — leading many to believe the weapons
                    themselves thirst for betrayal and blood.

            <h1 class="center-column, skz-viking">The Ruins Today</h1>
            <p>Even reaching Kitezh is an achievement. The city lies five days’ journey below the surface, buried deep
                within the bones of the mountain. Adventurers must brave the endless dark, winding through lightless
                caverns where every step echoes like a warning. The most direct path cuts through the dominion of the
                drow, whose watchful eyes never miss intruders, and whose ambushes are swift and merciless. Beyond their
                shadowed halls lie tunnels teeming with monstrous denizens: chittering swarms, blind stone-hunters, and
                great cavern beasts that stalk without sound. Supplies dwindle, torches burn low, and madness creeps at
                the edges of the mind long before the first glimpse of Kitezh’s shattered gates. </p>
            <p>Those who reach her gates face a tomb of rock and sorrow, but truth known, so few have
                returned from those depths that little is known other than rumour and supposition.</p>

            <ull>
                <li>Collapsed Grand Halls filled with overturned pillars and broken mosaics of dwarven runes,
                    half-buried in dust and cinders.</li>
                <li>Embers in the Stone: some stones appear scorched, carrying faint glowing sigils—possibly wards or
                    curses still alive.</li>
                <li>Hidden Vaults glimpsed through crevices in the rubble; dwarven tools and relics might remain intact,
                    but unstable rock threatens to seal them forever.</li>
                <li>Stone Sentinels: fractured statues of dwarven heroes line collapsed corridors—some say they shift if
                    your back is turned.</li>
                </ol>
