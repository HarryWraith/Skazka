            <h2 id="overview" class="tb-title">Overview</h2>
            <p>Once the heart of a powerful necromantic sect, the Ruins of Orishan lie amid the shifting dunes of
                formerly fertile Kaijistan, on the banks of a long-dry river bed. As a living city, Orishan stood proud
                in the Kingdom of Kaijistan; now, its skeleton stands half-buried in wind-blown sand, a grim warning to
                those who dare to enter.</p>
            <p>Though many adventurers have attempted to carve their names into its crumbling stone, few return — and
                those who do tell hushed tales of whispers in the corridors and undead shadows moving beneath the moon.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-title">Origin, Decline &amp; Current state</h3>
            <p><strong>Origin</strong>: Established deep within mountain folds, Kitezh was crafted from grey granite and
                revered for its masterful works—vaulted halls, carved effigies, and runic architecture.</p>
            <p><strong>Decline</strong>: Bound by their oath to serve as the gods’ smiths, the dwarves endured until
                they rose in revolt, burning much of the city though pockets survived; its fall was abrupt and brutal,
                for control had long been enforced by duergar “betrayers” and a Kua Toa garrison—but once the dwarven
                legions committed, the city was finished.</p>
            <p><strong>Current state</strong>: Reaching Kitezh is a feat in itself: five days below the surface through
                lightless caverns, past the drow’s merciless patrols and tunnels prowled by silent beasts, as supplies
                fade and sanity frays. Few ever return, so rumor fills the gaps: collapsed grand halls of toppled
                pillars and shattered rune mosaics; scorched stone veined with faint, glowing sigils—wards or curses
                still alive; hidden vaults glimpsed through rubble, rich with relics but one tremor from entombment; and
                fractured stone sentinels that some swear shift when you turn away.</p>

            <blockquote>“No amount of gold or gems would make any sane Dwarf return those cursed halls. Though riches
                there are for sure.” <span class="skz-quote-attribution">—
                    Dimrek, Quartermaster of Nav'golam</span></blockquote>

            <ul>
                <li>Whispers of battle still ring through the halls — the clash of hammers, the cries of revolt. Those
                    who linger too long may suddenly find themselves surrounded by ghostly scenes of the uprising. Few
                    return after witnessing them.</li>
                <li>Statues of dwarves line the ruins. Some are broken, others eerily intact. Travelers swear their eyes
                    follow intruders, and in rare cases the statues move to block paths or crush trespassers.</li>
                <li>Local folklore insists that breathing the dust of Kitezh dooms the lungs — many who leave the ruins
                    are struck by a slow suffocation, as though the mountain still chokes them.</li>

            <h3 class="tb-title skz-title">Loot myth</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A rumour persists of a hidden vault containing weapons forged before the uprising. Every expedition
                    that has sought them has ended in disaster — leading many to believe the weapons themselves thirst
                    for betrayal and blood.</li>
                <li>Somewhere in Kitezh are the Gauntlets of the Gods - said to allow the wearer to mine with their bare
                    hands.</li>

                <li>The dwarves collapsed many passages during the rebellion. The mountain remains treacherous — walls
                    crumble, ceilings groan, and entire corridors can vanish under sudden rockslides.</li>
