                    <li><strong>Cultivation</strong> — More than an academy—this is where raw magical talent is sparked

            <h2 id="overview" class="tb-title" style="margin-top:10px">Overview</h2>
            <p>Perched like a mirage above the scorched desert sands, Vitsenholm—the City of Beasts—hovers 300 feet
                aloft, a titanic relic of ancient power. Its foundations were forged not by mortal hands, but by the
                activation of an otherworldly artefact embedded in a buried metallic city found in 921 CR. Suddenly
                awakened, the city ascended into the sky and resections suspended by arcane engines that pulse with
                enigmatic energies. A realm of scholarship and wild wonder, it shimmers on the horizon—a sanctuary for
                the beast races and those drawn to the magic that hums in its core. This is a city of whispered secrets,
                magical brilliance, and creatures that blink at the limits of legend.</p>
            <p>Travel here is a journey itself: either by the wings of Aarakocra or via the teleportation ring on the
                desert floor, which catapults visitors into the floating realm. Once aboard expect narrow, solemn
                corridors lit by glowing runes and the hum of magic. Markets teem with potent potions and shimmering
                scrolls—still, they pale before the true wonders hidden in the sealed lower levels.</p>
            <p>Tongues of every race swirl together with the scent of exotic spices and the quiet crackle of arcane
                wards.</p>
            <p>Beware, though: from beyond the Barrier, lizard-like dragon riders attack—swift and sudden assaults that
                shatter serenity. Who these assailants are is still a mystery.</p>

            <p>A modest inn with warm meals and jumbled laughter—anchored by a statue of a terrified Kenku. Speculation
                over its presence circulates like smoke through the dining hall, but the staff smiles and turns away,
                and the shadowed eyes of the statue seem to stare with knowing dread.</p>
