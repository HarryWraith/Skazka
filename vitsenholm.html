            <h4 class="skz-viking">Population</h4>
            <p>Vitsenholm is a haven where the beast races flourish. Aarakocra and Thri-Kreen make up the
                majority—talons and multifaceted eyes glinting with innate magic. But all manner of beings—Leonin,
                Loxodon, Tabaxi—walk its promenades, while elves and humans mingle in cloaks and formal robes, as
                diplomats or visiting scholars. Though small in number, its population is dense with talent, ambition,
                and the restless curiosity that draws the magical-minded. Here, the air hums with the sounds of
                different tongues and the soft flaps of feathered wings, all united by a shared belief: in
                Vitsenholm, magic and acceptance are the pillars of society.</p>
            <h4 class="skz-viking">Politics</h4>
            <p>Ruled by a Magocracy of seven mages—Magisters reigning through intellect and arcane power—Vitsenholm
                blends authority and academia. Each Magister leads a guild essential to the city's function:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The seventh seat is elected by the populace every four years—a rare democratic thread woven into an
                    otherwise strict hierarchy.</li>
                <li>Six guilds, each headed by a Magister drawn from the beast races, guide the city’s magic, research,
                    law, and exploration.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Together, these Magisters direct the city’s arcane defences, expansions, and alliances, forging decisions
                in candlelit councils and dusty libraries.</p>

            <p>Perched like a mirage above the scorched desert sands, Vitsenholm—the City of Beasts—hovers 300 feet
                aloft, a titanic relic of ancient power. Its foundations were forged not by mortal hands, but by the
                activation of an otherworldly artefact embedded in a buried metallic city found in 921 CR. Suddenly
                awakened, the city ascended into the sky and remains suspended by arcane engines that pulse with
                enigmatic energies. A realm of scholarship and wild wonder, it shimmers on the horizon—a sanctuary for
                the beast races and those drawn to the magic that hums in its core. This is a city of whispered secrets,
                magical brilliance, and creatures that blink at the limits of legend.</p>

            <h4 class="skz-viking">The Raven Claw (Outer Ring)</h4>
            <p>A modest inn with warm meals and jumbled laughter—anchored by a statue of a terrified Kenku. Speculation
                over its presence circulates like smoke through the dining hall, but the staff smiles and turns away,
                and the shadowed eyes of the statue seem to stare with knowing dread.</p>

            <h4 class="skz-viking">The House of Thorns (Outer Ring)</h4>
            <p>A bathhouse and brothel that serves all—curves and claws welcome. Overseen by Noda Deq, an Owlkin
                proprietor, its many alcoves offer solace, secrets, and a fragrant blend of oils steeped in forbidden
                alchemy.</p>

            <h4 class="skz-viking">The Great Engine Chamber (Central Core)</h4>
            <p>A cathedral of metal and magic at the city’s heart. The engine pulses with incandescent engravings and
                the City’s anti-magic shield spreads outward from here, a protective cocoon shimmering like a heat-haze.
            </p>

            <h4 class="skz-viking">The Forbidden Grotto (Lower Core)</h4>
            <p>Behind sealed doors lies a labyrinth of black fungus—its spores drift in the stale air, whispering
                madness. Rumours say the floor below contains vast archives and strange machinery left untouched since
                the city was originally abandoned.</p>

            <h4 class="skz-viking">The Observatory of Seeing (Upper Core)</h4>
            <p>Perched atop the administrative sector, its dome holds telescopes and crystal orbs. Magical resonance
                drifts through the lenses, recording the far desert dunes—or perhaps the stars that bleed between
                realms.</p>

            <h4 class="skz-viking">Guilded Promenade (Central to Outer Ring)</h4>
            <p>A broad, covered walkway lined with stalls offering resplendent scrolls, trinkets, and flickering
                potions. Here, whispers from the Antiquity Guild recruit daring explorers—and midnight auctions tempt
                rogues yearning to taste artifacts forbidden to ordinary sight.</p>

            <h2 class="skz-viking">Visiting Vitsenholm</h2>
            <p>Travel here is a journey itself: either by the wings of Aarakocra or via the teleportation ring on the
                desert floor, which catapults visitors into the floating realm. Once aboard expect narrow, solemn
                corridors lit by glowing runes and the hum of magic. Markets teem with potent potions and shimmering
                scrolls—still, they pale before the true wonders hidden in the sealed lower levels.</p>

            <p>Tongues of every race swirl together with the scent of exotic spices and the quiet crackle of arcane
                wards.</p>

            <p>Beware, though: from beyond the Barrier, lizard-like dragon riders attack—swift and sudden assaults that
                shatter serenity. Who these assailants are is still a mystery.</p>
            <h2 class="skz-viking">Guilds</h2>
            <p>Here’s a deeper look into the city’s driving forces:</p>
            <p><b>Domestic Protection</b> – A city watch and investigative guild led by Magister Xekner Grandtooth, a
                Leonin Evocation wizard. His Eldritch Knights patrol the skies, while his Inquisitor Rogues decipher
                hidden threats.</p>
            <p><b>Navigators</b> – Caretakers of the Great Engine, the city's beating heart. Magister Tal’al, a
                Thri-Kreen Artificer, ensures the city remains aloft and humming.</p>
            <p><b>Cultivation</b> – More than an academy—this is where raw magical talent is sparked into brilliance.
                Overseen by Magister Badurid Stonebill, an Owlkin Clockwork Soul Sorcerer and headmaster extraordinaire.
            </p>
            <p><b>Law Society</b> – Bridging enchantment and governance, Magister Khaia—an Aarakocra Enchantment
                Wizard—crafts laws and diplomats in equal measure.</p>
            <p><b>Antiquity</b> – Driven into the sands below, Magister Pak’chaka, a Thri-Kreen Bard, leads expeditions
                to unravel the secrets of the ancient engine-city beneath.</p>
            <p><b>Research</b> – Standing at the city’s skylit workshops, Magister Cad, an Aarakocra Transmutation
                Wizard, dissects recovered artefacts in search of wonders yet unseen.</p>
