            <h2 class="tb-title">Overview</h2>

            <p>The Elves of Skazka are a people defined by duality—beings who embody both shadow and light, beauty and
                cruelty, wisdom and arrogance. Among all mortal races, none command such respect or inspire such unease.
                Their lifespans stretch across centuries, allowing them to weave intricate schemes, cultivate vast
                stores of knowledge, and influence the course of history with a subtlety that others can scarcely
                perceive. Yet despite their long memories, the origins of the Elves remain shrouded in mystery. They
                emerged from a schism, one that continues to shape their destiny: a people born of shadow who have
                chosen different paths toward or away from the light.</p>
            <p>At their core, the Elves are seekers. They are driven by questions of power, freedom, and meaning, but
                the answers they pursue differ among their kindreds. Dark Elves hunger for control and dominance, their
                desires shaped by <a href="lolth.html">Lolth’s</a> cruel web. Sun Elves seek liberation and
                enlightenment, striving to build
                communities founded on trust and cooperation. Wood Elves yearn for harmony with the natural world, their
                lives guided by the cycles of forest and season. Yet across all their forms, Elves are united by an
                insatiable curiosity and ambition. They cannot remain idle; whether through mastery of shadow, devotion
                to light, or communion with the living world, they seek to shape destiny—both their own and that of
                Skazka itself.</p>
            <p>The Elves occupy an ambiguous place in the societies of Skazka. Their longevity and wisdom make them
                invaluable as advisors, scholars, and spellcasters, but their air of superiority and hidden agendas
                inspire mistrust. Sun Elves have integrated most readily, establishing kingdoms, trading with <a
                    href="humans.html">humans</a>,
                and spreading their knowledge. Wood Elves maintain selective alliances, offering counsel when it serves
                to protect their forests but guarding their secrets closely. Dark Elves, in contrast, are rarely
                welcomed; their loyalty to <a href="lolth.html">Lolth</a> and their penchant for intrigue ensure that
                they are viewed as
                dangerous adversaries more often than allies. Despite these divisions, all Elves exert an undeniable
                influence wherever they walk, their presence a reminder that they are not merely another mortal race but
                living echoes of forces older than time itself.

        <article class="tb-panel" id="physiology">
            <h2 class="tb-title">Physiology & Traits</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Elves are fine-boned and long-limbed, with high cheekbones, tapering
                    ears, and luminous eyes that catch even faint light—but their look shifts by kindred. </li>
                <li><strong>Dimorphism:</strong> Elven sexual dimorphism is subtle: across kindreds, males and females
                    are near-matched in height, agility, and lifespan, with differences showing more in bearing than in
                    body. </li>
                <li><strong>Senses:</strong> Elven senses sit a notch above mortal norms in quiet, effortless ways:
                    sight that reads shape and motion in dim starlight as if the world were inked in silver.</li>
                <li><strong>Innate Gifts:</strong> Elves carry a quiet birthright: eyes that read the world in moonlit
                    greys, senses trained from a lifetime of listening, and a mind that shrugs off coaxing—charms slip,
                    and sleep-magic finds no purchase. They do not truly sleep; instead they sink into a four-hour
                    reverie, walking old memories like gardens and rising as rested as others after a full night. Their
                    grace is practiced rather than gaudy—sure feet, balanced hands, and a talent for stillness that
                    makes them hard to catch unready.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Virtues & Laws:</strong> Elven virtue in Skazka centers on poise, memory, and stewardship:
                    patience in craft and study, candor tempered by grace, promises kept across centuries, and a
                    near-sacred duty to protect what endures—knowledge, living places, and sworn bonds.</li>
                <li><strong>Craft & Trade:</strong> Elven craft marries longevity to grace: work meant to endure for
                    centuries, tuned to light, line, and living materials.</li>
                <li><strong>Family & Names:</strong> Elven families are long-rooted and deliberate: bonds form over
                    decades, households often span three or four living generations, and fosterage between allied houses
                    braids loyalties.</li>
                <li><strong>Customs & Rites:</strong> Elven customs revolve around memory, oath, and the quiet
                    stewardship of beautiful things.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Birth begins with a Naming Vigil, when kin keep watch while
                            artisans craft a first token to “anchor” the child’s place in memory.</li>
                        <li> marriages are sealed by Joined Work, a piece made together and gifted to the household
                            shrine.</li>
                        <li>Hospitality is sacred: guests eat before they speak.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Patrons:</strong> Elven worship in Skazka polarizes around two stark patrons: <a
                        href="aeter.html">Aeter</a>, the
                    Lightbringer, and <a href="lolth.html">Lolth</a>, the Spider Queen. </li>
                <li><strong>Origin Story:</strong> In Skazka’s telling, the elven story begins in shadow: dark-elf
                    ancestors lived under Lolth’s tyranny in the Underworld until a faction fled upward, surviving a
                    brutal exodus to the surface where the god Aeter received them and bestowed the Everlight—a
                    revelation that remade their bodies and ethos, giving rise to the radiant Sun Elves. </li>
                <li><strong>Rites & Taboos:</strong> Beyond their better-known ceremonies, elves keep a lattice of
                    quieter observances and red lines: eating what speaks (creatures known to mimic words),
                    pointing with a naked blade, are both taboo.</li>
                <li><strong>Omens & Festivals (Sun Elves):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sun Elves: Dawn's renewal: at sunrise on the longest day, in silence, all lights are
                            extinguished
                            except one; the keeper lamp. The fire from this lamp is then used to relight all other lamps
                            and torches.</li>
                        <li>Dark Elves: The veil of shadows: for one day each year the city is illuminated with
                            painfully bright lights. This is to remind all that the darkness protects them.</li>
                    </ul>

            <p>Elven kind in Skazka branches along three enduring lines—Sun, Wood, and Dark—each sprung from a shared
                ancestry but reshaped by patronage, habitat, and long memory. All elves are keen-sensed, long-lived,
                oath-minded, and crafted for grace; from that common spine, Sun Elves turn toward Aeter’s Everlight and
                civic artistry, Wood Elves fold themselves into living forests with quiet stewardship and rangercraft,
                and Dark Elves (drow) master the Underworld’s hierarchies, shadowed magics, and knife-edged politics
                under Lolth’s gaze. What follows surveys their origins, temperaments, gifts, laws, and lifeways—where
                they agree, where they differ, and how each kindred’s choices echo across centuries.</p>

            <h3 class="tb-title">Sun Elves</h3>
            <p>The Sun Elves trace their lineage to those who escaped Lolth’s tyranny, emerging into the light of the
                surface after a harrowing exodus through the Underworld. Their salvation came with the god Aeter, who
                granted them the Everlight and revealed that magic could heal, inspire, and illuminate rather than only
                dominate and destroy. Their transformation was profound: their dark skin lightened to radiant golds,
                their hair warmed to tones of sunlight, and their eyes began to shine with the hues of the sky. Sun Elf
                society is built upon cooperation, artistry, and trust, their lives devoted to building rather than
                scheming. Yet their openness can also be a vulnerability, for their willingness to trust sometimes
                leaves them unprepared for the ambitions of others. <span class="tag">Children of the light</span></p>
        </article>

        <article class="tb-panel">
            <h3 class="tb-title">Wood Elves</h3>
            <p>From the Sun Elves came the Wood Elves, who journeyed into the vast forests of Kelos and reshaped
                themselves in harmony with living nature. With green undertones to their skin, earthy hair, and silent,
                fluid movements, they became creatures of the forest canopy. Their bond with the woodland is spiritual
                as much as physical; they read the whispers of trees, feel the tremors in root networks, and commune
                with the subtle magics of growth and balance. The Wood Elves are guardians of ancient secrets hidden
                beneath the forest, their philosophy rooted in preservation and seclusion. Though not isolationist by
                nature, their trust is hard-won, for they have seen how easily outsiders can disrupt delicate balances.
                Their tree-grown cities remain almost invisible to the untrained eye, living architecture that is
                cultivated rather than built. They are the keepers of wisdom as old as Skazka itself, and they guard it
                with unyielding resolve. <span class="tag">Haldaja</span></p>

            <h3 class="tb-title">Dark Elves</h3>
            <p>The Dark Elves, or Drow, dwell in the deepest shadows of the Underworld. Born from living darkness, they
                embody both beauty and corruption. Their cities are feats of impossible architecture, suspended from
                cavern ceilings and paved with whispering stones, yet their civilization teeters constantly on the brink
                of collapse. Lolth, the Spider Queen, reigns over them with ruthless devotion, shaping their society
                into a hierarchy of betrayal, intrigue, and fear. Under her priestesses, every interaction becomes a
                contest of manipulation, every relationship a fragile web ready to snap. Masters of poison,
                shadow-magic, and deception, the Dark Elves are formidable foes, but their society’s self-destructive
                nature ensures that they are as much a threat to themselves as they are to the world above.<span

        <article class="tb-panel">
            <h3 class="tb-title">Shadow Elves</h3>
            <p>Shadow Elves are an exiled kindred from a parallel dusk-realm, sworn to cross the veil wherever
                corruption roots and to burn it out with truth. Pale as moon-ash with ink-dark eyes, they carry Ioun’s
                sigil—the seeing diamond—on veils, rings, and lantern-helms, and hold that ignorance is the first evil:
                lies, secrecy, and willful forgetfulness are sins to scour. Their creed marries piety to purpose—daily
                recitations from memory-cods, fasts of silence before a hunt, and the Vow of Three Lights (to reveal, to
                remember, to resist). In battle they are zeal made graceful: blades etched with scripture, prism-charms
                that throw radiant lattices through shadow, and a talent for stepping along the rim of darkness without
                being swallowed by it. They mistrust courts and cabals that hide behind oaths untested, feud bitterly
                with Lolth’s priesthood, and treat Aeter’s faithful as distant kin who have forgotten the hard edge of
                truth. When a gate opens, they arrive like a hush before storm—mask-lamps flaring, questions first,
                steel after—and leave behind ordered archives so evil, once named, cannot take root again.<span
