            <h4 class="skz-viking">Physical Description</h4>
            <p>Elves are known for their striking beauty, but this beauty manifests differently across their kindreds.
                Graceful and slender, they move with an otherworldly elegance that seems almost unnatural to mortal
                eyes. Their features are sharp, often too perfect to be mistaken for merely human, and their eyes hold
                depths that speak of lifetimes of experience. Yet their physical forms are shaped as much by their
                environments and choices as by their ancestry. Dark Elves bear the midnight hues of their subterranean
                origins, Sun Elves glow with golden tones kissed by the light of the Everlight, and Wood Elves carry the
                subtle greens and browns of the forest canopy. In every case, their forms reflect the essence of the
                realms they call home.</p>

            <p>The Elves of Skazka are a people defined by duality—beings who embody both shadow and light, beauty and
                cruelty, wisdom and arrogance. Among all mortal races, none command such respect or inspire such unease.
                Their lifespans stretch across centuries, allowing them to weave intricate schemes, cultivate vast
                stores of knowledge, and influence the course of history with a subtlety that others can scarcely
                perceive. Yet despite their long memories, the origins of the Elves remain shrouded in mystery. They
                emerged from a schism, one that continues to shape their destiny: a people born of shadow who have
                chosen different paths toward or away from the light.</p>

            <h4 class="skz-viking">Heritage</h4>
            <p>All Elves share a common origin in the deep places of the world, where shadows and raw magic pooled in
                the earliest ages. From this foundation, their people diverged. The Dark Elves remained below, bound to
                Lolth, the Spider Queen, and shaped by her dominion of cruelty and deception. Those who fled her tyranny
                emerged into the surface world, reborn under the guidance of Aeter, the God of Sun and Song, and became
                the Sun Elves. Later still, the Sun Elves’ descendants spread outward into the forests, adapting
                themselves to the rhythms of living woods and becoming the Wood Elves, or Haldaja. This branching
                lineage—the eternal tension between shadow, light, and harmony—forms the eternal tapestry of Elvenkind.

            <h2 class="skz-viking">Motivation</h2>
            <p>At their core, the Elves are seekers. They are driven by questions of power, freedom, and meaning, but
                the answers they pursue differ among their kindreds. Dark Elves hunger for control and dominance, their
                desires shaped by Lolth’s cruel web. Sun Elves seek liberation and enlightenment, striving to build
                communities founded on trust and cooperation. Wood Elves yearn for harmony with the natural world, their
                lives guided by the cycles of forest and season. Yet across all their forms, Elves are united by an
                insatiable curiosity and ambition. They cannot remain idle; whether through mastery of shadow, devotion
                to light, or communion with the living world, they seek to shape destiny—both their own and that of
                Skazka itself.</p>
            <h2 class="skz-viking">Integration into Society</h2>
            <p>The Elves occupy an ambiguous place in the societies of Skazka. Their longevity and wisdom make them
                invaluable as advisors, scholars, and spellcasters, but their air of superiority and hidden agendas
                inspire mistrust. Sun Elves have integrated most readily, establishing kingdoms, trading with humans,
                and spreading their knowledge. Wood Elves maintain selective alliances, offering counsel when it serves
                to protect their forests but guarding their secrets closely. Dark Elves, in contrast, are rarely
                welcomed; their loyalty to Lolth and their penchant for intrigue ensure that they are viewed as
                dangerous adversaries more often than allies. Despite these divisions, all Elves exert an undeniable
                influence wherever they walk, their presence a reminder that they are not merely another mortal race but
                living echoes of forces older than time itself.</p>
            <h2 class="skz-viking">Dark Elves – The Children of the Web</h2>
            <p>The Dark Elves, or Drow, dwell in the deepest shadows of the Underworld. Born from living darkness, they
                embody both beauty and corruption. Their cities are feats of impossible architecture, suspended from
                cavern ceilings and paved with whispering stones, yet their civilization teeters constantly on the brink
                of collapse. Lolth, the Spider Queen, reigns over them with ruthless devotion, shaping their society
                into a hierarchy of betrayal, intrigue, and fear. Under her priestesses, every interaction becomes a
                contest of manipulation, every relationship a fragile web ready to snap. Masters of poison,
                shadow-magic, and deception, the Dark Elves are formidable foes, but their society’s self-destructive
                nature ensures that they are as much a threat to themselves as they are to the world above.</p>
            <h2 class="skz-viking">Sun Elves – The Liberated Children of Light</h2>
            <p>The Sun Elves trace their lineage to those who escaped Lolth’s tyranny, emerging into the light of the
                surface after a harrowing exodus through the Underworld. Their salvation came with the god Aeter, who
                granted them the Everlight and revealed that magic could heal, inspire, and illuminate rather than only
                dominate and destroy. Their transformation was profound: their dark skin lightened to radiant golds,
                their hair warmed to tones of sunlight, and their eyes began to shine with the hues of the sky. Sun Elf
                society is built upon cooperation, artistry, and trust, their lives devoted to building rather than
                scheming. Yet their openness can also be a vulnerability, for their willingness to trust sometimes
                leaves them unprepared for the ambitions of others.</p>
            <h2 class="skz-viking">Wood Elves – The Forest-Crowned Haldaja</h2>
            <p>From the Sun Elves came the Wood Elves, who journeyed into the vast forests of Kelos and reshaped
                themselves in harmony with living nature. With green undertones to their skin, earthy hair, and silent,
                fluid movements, they became creatures of the forest canopy. Their bond with the woodland is spiritual
                as much as physical; they read the whispers of trees, feel the tremors in root networks, and commune
                with the subtle magics of growth and balance. The Wood Elves are guardians of ancient secrets hidden
                beneath the forest, their philosophy rooted in preservation and seclusion. Though not isolationist by
                nature, their trust is hard-won, for they have seen how easily outsiders can disrupt delicate balances.
                Their tree-grown cities remain almost invisible to the untrained eye, living architecture that is
                cultivated rather than built. They are the keepers of wisdom as old as Skazka itself, and they guard it
                with unyielding resolve.</p>
            <h2 class="skz-viking">The Eternal Tapestry</h2>
            <p>Though divided into three great branches—Dark, Sun, and Wood—the Elves remain bound together by shared
                origins. Each kindred represents a different answer to the same questions of power, freedom, and
                balance. The Drow embraced dominance, the Sun Elves sought liberation, and the Wood Elves pursued
                harmony. Each gained wisdom and power, but each also bears burdens unique to their path. Yet for all
                their divisions, they remain unmistakably Elven: long-lived, ambitious, and forever caught between the
                pull of shadow and the promise of light. Their choices ripple outward across Skazka, weaving destinies
                that shape not only their people but the fate of the world itself.</p>
