      <!-- ===== Overview ===== -->
      <h2 id="overview" class="tb-title">Overview</h2>
      <p>Mortifer was born beneath the counting-houses of Velkaria, ignored even by his own lineage. He watched as
        brothers inherited, sisters were adored, and his father spoke only of legacy — never his. His first kill was not
        rage, but experiment. The next, calculation. Then came artistry. As the bodies fell and his family's line
        crumbled, Mortifer’s name rose like smoke over a ruined ledger. But even wealth and titles could not still his
        hunger. He turned to the forbidden: blood sorcery, exile-born rites, the carving of power into flesh.</p>

      <p>On a night soaked in red moonlight, Mortifer killed the city’s entire merchant council — thirteen blades,
        thirteen names, thirteen deaths in one breath. When dawn broke, he stood alone amidst chaos, not merely feared
        but revered. The divine took notice — not to bless him, but to acknowledge him. With each murder done in
        ambition, his essence deepened. With each assassin’s whisper, his shadow lengthened.</p>

      <p>He is now worshipped in silence, invoked without voice. No church dares claim him — and yet every assassin,
        every traitor, every power-hungry soul knows his mark. He is the god of murder not as madness, but as method.

    <!-- ===== Influence
 ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="domains">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Influence</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Planned to perfection</strong>: Mortifier is not just about murder, but murder which is planned
          immactulately.</li>
        <li><strong>Slay thy borother</strong>: ambition above everything else. Even family should not be above
          scheming.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Symbols  ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="symbols">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Symbols</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>A nod and a wink</strong>: A blood-slick dagger plunged into a coin; this is the calling card of
          those who serve Mortifer.</li>
        <li><strong>A dire warning</strong>: a severed hand clutching thirteen black threads; this is the symbol which
          indicates refuge is close-by for those who follow the Lord of Murder.</li>
        <li><strong>Guess whose coming to dinner</strong>: a tarot card with a red crescent moon biting through
          darkness; a gift given to those a devotee intends on killing.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- ===== Tenets ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="tenets">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Tenets</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A life taken must be owed—honor the contract, the price, and the mark.</li>
        <li>Kill with precision, not passion; waste is heresy, witnesses are indulgence.</li>
        <li>Let silence be your creed—secrets kept, coin counted, threads cut clean.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Rites & Offerings ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="rites">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Rites</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Rite of Thirteen</strong>: A ritual killing involving thirteen symbolic elements — thirteen
          blades, thirteen heartbeats, thirteen names whispered. Said to draw Mortifer's gaze directly and confer dark
          favor or protection in exchange for the killer’s own soul fraying.</li>
        <li><strong>Velkarian Marking</strong>: Practitioners slice the rune of Mortifer — an angular glyph resembling a
          dagger through an eye — into their skin before committing a murder-for-power. Done properly, the mark never
          scars, only deepens.</li>
        <li><strong>The Crimson Silence</strong>: A vow taken by assassins, never to speak of the act once done. Each
          broken vow supposedly awakens a fragment of Mortifer within, leading to madness or worse — divine possession.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <!-- ===== Avatars & Interventions ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="avatars">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Avatars</h2>
      <p>It is said that Mortifer takes the form has a black rat to best observe his followers.

    <!-- ===== Lore ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="lore">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Lore</h2>
      <p>A tattered book said to exist which lists every name Mortifer has claimed. No ink, only impressions — names
        felt rather than read.</p>
