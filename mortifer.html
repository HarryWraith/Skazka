      <p>Mortifer was born beneath the counting-houses of Velkaria, ignored even by his own lineage. He watched as
        brothers
        inherited, sisters were adored, and his father spoke only of legacy — never his. His first kill was not rage,
        but
        experiment. The next, calculation. Then came artistry. As the bodies fell and his family's line crumbled,
        Mortifer’s
        name rose like smoke over a ruined ledger. But even wealth and titles could not still his hunger. He turned to
        the
        forbidden: blood sorcery, exile-born rites, the carving of power into flesh.</p>

      <p>On a night soaked in red moonlight, Mortifer killed the city’s entire merchant council — thirteen blades,
        thirteen
        names, thirteen deaths in one breath. When dawn broke, he stood alone amidst chaos, not merely feared but
        revered. The
        divine took notice — not to bless him, but to acknowledge him. With each murder done in ambition, his essence
        deepened.
        With each assassin’s whisper, his shadow lengthened.</p>

      <p>He is now worshipped in silence, invoked without voice. No church dares claim him — and yet every assassin,
        every
        traitor, every power-hungry soul knows his mark. He is the god of murder not as madness, but as method.</p>

      <ul class="nodec">
        <li><b>The Rite of Thirteen</b>: A ritual killing involving thirteen symbolic elements — thirteen blades,
          thirteen heartbeats, thirteen names whispered. Said to draw Mortifer's gaze directly and confer dark favor or
          protection in exchange for the killer’s own soul fraying.</li>
        <li><b>Velkarian Marking</b>: Practitioners slice the rune of Mortifer — an angular glyph resembling a dagger
          through an eye — into their skin before committing a murder-for-power. Done properly, the mark never scars,
          only deepens.</li>
        <li><b>The Crimson Silence</b>: A vow taken by assassins, never to speak of the act once done. Each broken vow
          supposedly awakens a fragment of Mortifer within, leading to madness or worse — divine possession.</li>

        <li><b>Planned to perfection</b>: Mortifier is not just about murder, but murder which is planned immactulately.
        </li>
        <li><b>Slay thy borother</b>: ambition above everything else. Even family should not be above scheming.</li>

      <ul class="nodec">
        <li>He proved himself divine. In the mercantile sprawl of Velkaria, where
          merchants bartered souls and family was priced in ledgers, he was a forgotten child: the seventh son, the
          unmentioned heir. But Mortifer did not beg for legacy. He seized it, body by body, crime by crime, blade by
          blade. His murders were not acts of madness — they were assertions of order, deliberate, ritualistic,
          inevitable.</li>

        <li>Thinning the world of his rivals until only he remained. The gods took notice
          when mortals fled from his shadow rather than from theirs. They watched as he carved divinity into himself —
          not through worship, but through work.</li>

        <li>His sermons are written in bloodstains. His hymns are
          final breaths.</li>

        <li>A tattered book said to list every name Mortifer has claimed. No ink,
          only impressions — names felt rather than read.</li>

        <li>A black-bladed relic believed to be the very knife used to slay the
          merchant council. It thirsts audibly when near betrayal.</li>

        <li>Etched onto bone, readable only under blood-moonlight. Reciting one is said
          to hide a murderer from all gods — save Mortifer.</li>
