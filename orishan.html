            <h2 class="tb-title">Origins</h2>
            <p>Orishan was founded during Kaijistan’s more temperate era, along a now-vanished river that once sustained
                orchards and gardens. The necromancers who made it their home chose its location deliberately: near
                water, near old trade routes, and yet remote enough to avoid unwanted eyes.</p>
            <h2 class="tb-title">Decline</h2>
            <p>As the climate shifted and the river dried, the life that sustained Orishan withered. The necromancers’
                death-binding magic, once a source of power, may have ultimately contributed to its undoing: energies
                unchecked, magical backlash, perhaps even revolt by spirits or undead. The city was abandoned, left to
                the sands, but not to silence.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="center-column">
            <img src="assets/orishan_main.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Once the heart of a powerful necromantic sect, the Ruins of Orishan lie amid the shifting dunes of
                formerly fertile Kaijistan, on the banks of a long-dry river bed. As a living city, Orishan stood
                proud
                in the Kingdom of Kaijistan; now, its skeleton stands half-buried in wind-blown sand, a grim warning
                to
                those who dare to enter.</p>

            <p>Though many adventurers have attempted to carve their names into its crumbling stone, few return —
                and
                those who do tell hushed tales of whispers in the corridors and undead shadows moving beneath the
                moon.

            <h2 class="tb-title">Dangers & Rumours</h2>

            <p>The Ruins of Orishan are notoriously hazardous, even to well-prepared parties:</p>

            <ol class="toc-list">
                <li>Frequent sandstorms blast across the dry river bed, sometimes uncovering buried corridors — and
                    sometimes
                    burying them again in hours.</li>
                <li>Magical traps left by the necromancers (pressure plates, glyph wards) continue to trigger
                    unpredictably,
                    sometimes summoning skeletal guardians or releasing sudden gusts of choking sand.</li>
                <li>The undead are said to wander: skeletal servants, ghoulish forms half-buried, animated bone-dust
                    swirls.
                    Some adventurers claim to have seen larger constructs loom in moonlit corridors.</li>
                <li>The local tribes consider Orishan cursed. They warn travellers: any treasure removed from the
                    ruins
                    carries a lingering curse, bringing misfortune, nightmares, or worse. Those who survive return
                    afflicted by
                    strange dreams or disease-like symptoms.</li>
                <li>More than one search party has vanished entirely; local lore suggests that some corridors
                    rearrange
                    themselves, or lead into hidden subterranean chambers from which no one emerges.</li>

            <h2 class="center-column, tb-title">The Ruins Today</h2>

            <p>
                Orishan is a place of eerie beauty and unquiet dread. The dry river bed that skirts the ruins is now
                a
                cracked ribbon of worn stone, but during rare seasons, water may trickle through — though no living
                thing
                seems drawn to it.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">The Sand-choked Courtyard</h2>
            <img src="assets/orishan_courtyard.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                Once a grand plaza with statues depicting necromancers in hooded robes and stylised skeletal
                figures,
                now
                half buried in dunes. Occasionally, wind exposes fragments of broken marble, some carved with
                half-erased
                glyphs.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">The Ossuary Hall</h2>
            <p>
                A long corridor lined with niches that once held skulls, bones, and bone-crafted reliquaries. Some
                niches
                remain, others are empty. Adventurers report a faint rattling of small bones shifting in the gloom.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">The Bone Glyph Chambers</h2>
            <p>
                Off the main hall lie several small chambers whose walls are carved with mystic runes inlaid with
                powdered
                bone dust. Some glyphs glow faintly in moonlight, and rumour has it they can animate skeletons from
                the
                sand.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">The Whispering Catacombs</h2>
            <img src="assets/orishan_cata.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                Beneath the visible ruins lie catacombs partly filled by sand. Ancient wooden coffins, warped and
                rotted,
                rest among broken sarcophagi. Some say you can hear low, ghostly murmurs when the wind blows just
                right.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">The Necromancer’s Spire</h2>
            <p>
                Once a lighthouse-like tower rising above the city, its upper portion collapsed centuries ago. The
                lower
                spiral stair remains, leading into darkness. A few broken altars remain, stained and etched with
                dried
                blood
                and strange glyphic symbols.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="tb-panel">


            <p>The native tribes regard Orishan with deep suspicion. Many refuse to accept goods recovered
                from
                its
                ruins, claiming the curse travels with them. Some elders speak of dreams haunted by undead
                forms;
                others
                whisper that thieves who steal relics bring back misfortune to their whole clan.</p>

            <p>Some tribal legends suggest that the necromancers once invoked a curse on the city itself,
                binding
                restless spirits to the sands; thus, even buried sections of the ruins might respond to
                intruders.
