            <h2 id="overview" class="tb-title">Overview</h2>
            <p>Once the heart of a powerful necromantic sect, the Ruins of Orishan lie amid the shifting dunes of
                formerly fertile Kaijistan, on the banks of a long-dry river bed. As a living city, Orishan stood proud
                in the Kingdom of Kaijistan; now, its skeleton stands half-buried in wind-blown sand, a grim warning to
                those who dare to enter.</p>
            <p>Though many adventurers have attempted to carve their names into its crumbling stone, few return — and
                those who do tell hushed tales of whispers in the corridors and undead shadows moving beneath the moon.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-title">Origin, Decline &amp; Current state</h3>
            <p><strong>Origin</strong>: Orishan was founded during Kaijistan’s more temperate era, along a now-vanished
                river that once sustained
                orchards and gardens. The necromancers who made it their home chose its location deliberately: near
                water, near old trade routes, and yet remote enough to avoid unwanted eyes.</p>
            <p><strong>Decline</strong>: As the climate shifted and the river dried, the life that sustained Orishan
                withered. The necromancers’
                death-binding magic, once a source of power, may have ultimately contributed to its undoing: energies
                unchecked, magical backlash, perhaps even revolt by spirits or undead. The city was abandoned, left to
                the sands, but not to silence.</p>
            <p><strong>Current state</strong>: Orishan is a place of eerie beauty and unquiet dread. The dry river bed
                that skirts the ruins is now a cracked ribbon of worn stone, but during rare seasons, water may trickle
                through — though no living thing seems drawn to it.</p>

                        figures, now half buried in dunes. Occasionally, wind exposes fragments of broken marble, some
                        carved with half-erased glyphs.</p>

                        Some niches remain, others are empty. Adventurers report a faint rattling of small bones
                        shifting in the gloom.</p>

                        rotted, rest among broken sarcophagi. Some say you can hear low, ghostly murmurs when the wind

                        them; elders speak of haunted dreams and clans undone by stolen bones, for necromancers bound
                        the sands themselves to answer any intruder.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The undead are said to wander: skeletal servants, ghoulish forms half-buried, animated bone-dust
                    swirls. Some adventurers claim to have seen larger constructs loom in moonlit corridors.</li>
                <li>The local tribes consider Orishan cursed. They warn travellers: any treasure removed from the
                    ruins carries a lingering curse, bringing misfortune, nightmares, or worse. Those who survive return
                    afflicted by strange dreams or disease-like symptoms.</li>
                <li>More than one search party has vanished entirely; local lore suggests that some corridors
                    rearrange themselves, or lead into hidden subterranean chambers from which no one emerges.</li>

            <h3 class="tb-title skz-title">Dangers</h3>
            <p>The Ruins of Orishan are notoriously hazardous, even to well-prepared parties:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Frequent sandstorms blast across the dry river bed, sometimes uncovering buried corridors — and
                    sometimes burying them again in hours.</li>
                <li>Magical traps left by the necromancers (pressure plates, glyph wards) continue to trigger
                    unpredictably, sometimes summoning skeletal guardians or releasing sudden gusts of choking
                    sand.</li>
