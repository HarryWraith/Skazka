            <h4>Politics</h4>
            <p>Caratania is a monarchy ruled by King Alaric IV, whose dynasty claims direct descent from Hrothgar Bloodlance himself. While the crown commands loyalty, it is the Church of Aeter that truly shapes Caratanian life. The Church, through its grand clergy and militant Shield of Dawn, wields enormous influence over law, custom, and governance. Priests serve as judges, inquisitors, and advisors to the nobility, ensuring that both throne and people remain steadfast in their devotion. This balance between monarch and church has forged a state where piety is inseparable from politics, and faith is not a private matter but the very lifeblood of public order.</p>
             <h4>Population</h4>
            <P>Caratania counts a population of roughly 400,000 souls. The heart of the kingdom is the fortified city of Caratania itself, home to the royal court, and the high clergy. Beyond the city lie dozens of towns and villages scattered across the foothills of the Blood Mountains.</P>

            <p>Caratania is a brooding kingdom of mist-laden valleys and shadowed mountains, perched at the foot of the forbidding Blood Mountains. Its people are the descendants of warriors and martyrs, heirs to the unyielding defiance of Hrothgar Bloodlance and his companions who cast down the vampire lords of old. This land is one of superstition and faith, where every hearth bears charms against the restless dead and every household whispers prayers to Aeter, the Eternal Flame, before nightfall. Yet Caratania is not only a kingdom of vigilant hearts; it is also a land of rich vineyards and crimson wine, whose deep taste is said to carry both the sweetness of life and the memory of blood. It is a realm where legend and reality are woven so tightly that the people live in constant awe of their own history.</p>

            <h2>Visiting Caratania</h2>
            <p>Travelers who enter Caratania will find themselves in a land both beautiful and foreboding. The vineyards produce some of the most celebrated wines in all of Kelos, rich and dark, favored by nobles and merchants alike. Visitors are often struck by the strong religious character of the people—processions wind through the streets, bells toll at every hour, and even the inns bear symbols of Aeter to ward off evil. Foreigners are welcomed warmly enough, but always with an edge of watchfulness, for strangers might carry shadows with them. The nights are long in Caratania, and no traveler forgets the weight of unseen eyes when the moonlight falls upon the mountains.</p>
