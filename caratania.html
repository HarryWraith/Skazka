            <h2 id="overview" class="tb-title" style="margin-top:10px">Overview</h2>
            <p>Caratania is a brooding kingdom of mist-laden valleys and shadowed mountains, perched at the foot of the
                forbidding Blood Mountains. Its people are the descendants of warriors and martyrs, heirs to the
                unyielding defiance of Hrothgar Bloodlance and his companions who cast down the vampire lords of old.
                This land is one of superstition and faith, where every hearth bears charms against the restless dead
                and every household whispers prayers to Aeter, the Eternal Flame, before nightfall.</p>
            <p>While the crown commands loyalty, it is the Church of Aeter that truly shapes Caratanian life. Priests
                serve as judges, inquisitors, and advisors to the nobility, ensuring that both throne and people remain
                steadfast in their devotion. The militant Shield of Dawn drills in relentless cadence, and foreigners
                find welcome—measured, watchful, and always listening.</p>
            <p>Travelers who enter Caratania will find themselves in a land both beautiful and foreboding. The vineyards
                produce some of the most celebrated wines in all of Kelos, rich and dark, favored by nobles and
                merchants alike. Visitors are often struck by the strong religious character of the people—processions
                wind through the streets, bells toll at every hour, and even the inns bear symbols of Aeter to ward off
                evil. Foreigners are welcomed warmly enough, but always with an edge of watchfulness, for strangers
                might carry shadows with them. The nights are long in Caratania, and no traveler forgets the weight of
                unseen eyes when the moonlight falls upon the mountains.</p>
