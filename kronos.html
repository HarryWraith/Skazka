      <p>Before stars blinked or worlds spun, there was only the void—an abyss where silence rotted. From that emptiness
        rose the first gods: Uzume, goddess of creation; Kaos, lord of chaos; and Kronos, the cold keeper of cosmic
        time.</p>

      <p> Kronos did not shape or destroy—he counted. Time flowed through him, impartial and absolute. But when Uzume
        crafted
        the Annarr—divine beings born of love—Kronos grew bitter. She had purpose. He had only silence.</p>

      <p>Forbidden from harming her, Kronos conspired with Kaos and the great dragon Fafnirog, promising the beast
        divinity in
        exchange for betrayal. At the Celestial Forge, Fafnirog struck Uzume down. Kronos watched as her light scattered
        across the cosmos.</p>

      <p>But her dying breath cursed him. Uzume’s final gift was life itself, seeded in mortals—beyond the reach of
        Kronos or Kaos. The orderly flow of time became fractured, colored by chaos, emotion, and mortality.</p>

      <p>Kronos did not weep. He marked the moment.</p>

      <p>Now he drifts unseen at the edge of existence—never worshipped, only feared. Time continues, and through it, so
        does he. Not as a god of mercy or wrath, but as a quiet inevitability.</p>

      <p>He does not answer prayers. He measures them.</p>
