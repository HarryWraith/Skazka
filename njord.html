        In the pantheon of Skazka, Njord, the God of Storms and Anger, reigns as a roaring tempest. He is the
        embodiment of raw power and unbound fury — most akin to Kaos among the Annarr. Njord is neither savior nor
        destroyer by
        intent, but rather a force that challenges mortals to seize strength, seize power, or be swept away.
      </p>

      <ul class="nodec">
        <li>
          <b>The Siege of Stormkeep</b>: When Orcs besieged the coastal fortress of Stormkeep, Njord unleashed a
          week-long tempest. Waves battered the
          walls, lightning shattered siege towers, and only those defenders proven in battle earned spared lives. The
          story ends
          with the surviving knights swearing oaths under thunder to never yield.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The Trial of the Roaring Shore</b>: A rite of passage for warriors and sailors. They stand on the high
          cliffs as storms surge around them. Those who hold
          steady and return victorious are said to have Njord’s grit; those who falter are cast out — literally washed
          away by the
          returning tide. Those that fail are said to rise as 'The Drowned' - an undead creature bound to some Njord
          for
          eternity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Festival of the Wrathwind</b>: On the equinoxes, massive bonfires are lit along the coasts. Those that
          build these fires test their skill at keeping the fires
          alight during the storm. A blessing is said to be received - the Storm Kiss - by any who keep their
          watchfires
          going until dawn.

        <li>
          <b>Storm & Fury</b>: Njord commands lightning, roaring winds, and crushing waves. Sailors dread and respect
          his presence: appease him, and
          he grants safe passage; defy him, and ships vanish in whirlpools.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Anger & Resolve</b>: In his rage, Njord symbolizes both the destructive and galvanizing power of anger.
          He
          punishes those weak of
          conviction and empowers those who channel rage into action.
        </li>
        <b>Power & Meritocracy</b>: He embodies the survival-of-the-fittest ethos: power carved through struggle and
        borne by those who endure. He brooks
        no excuses or charity; only the strong earn his favor.

      <h2 class="tb-title">Lore</h2>
      <ul class="nodec">
        <li>Beneath the tempest-scorched ruins of an ancient lighthouse, sailors whisper that those struck by
          lightning
          during the “Oath of the Eye” — swearing unwavering resolve mid-storm — gain Njord’s silent favor. Their
          vision
          sharpens, able to peer through storm veils and spotting distant foes or hidden coves invisible to others.
          Yet,
          with each whisper of power, a sliver of their humanity fades, replaced by the distant roar of thunder
          echoing
          in their minds.</li>
        <li>In the sunken Forging Fane of Njord, master smiths brave drowned ruins during neap tides. When the sea
          is
          unnaturally calm — a stillness that only Njord grants — they forge weapons in seawater and lightning. The
          resulting blades hum with storm-song: they can crackle with electricity in battle, call forth a gust when
          waved, or part raging waters with a strike. But to wield such power is to court Njord’s wrath—should the
          weapon’s storm flicker out, the bearer is doomed to drown in a sudden storm of the god’s making.</li>
        <li>A secret sect of shieldmaidens draped in fragments of the Stormcloak once gathered during the Festival
          of
          the Wrathwind. By weaving thunderstrands from the cloak into their armor, they became Aegis of the Gale:
          shields that absorb lightning and release it in a titanic burst, or that conjure gale-force winds that
          hurl
          foes aside. Surviving members are said to carry the scent of ozone and the taste of salt on their skin —
          and
          their hearts beat with the pulse of a gathering storm.</li>
