      <!-- ===== Overview ===== -->
      <h2 id="overview" class="tb-title">Overview</h2>
      <p>In the pantheon of Skazka, Njord, the God of Storms and Anger, reigns as a roaring tempest. He is the
        embodiment of raw power and unbound fury — most akin to Kaos among the Annarr. Njord is neither savior nor
        destroyer by intent, but rather a force that challenges mortals to seize strength, seize power, or be swept
        away.</p>

    <!-- ===== Influence
 ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="domains">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Influence</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Storm & Fury</strong>: Njord commands lightning, roaring winds, and crushing waves. Sailors dread
          and respect his presence: appease him, and he grants safe passage; defy him, and ships vanish in whirlpools.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Anger & Resolve</strong>: In his rage, Njord symbolizes both the destructive and galvanizing power
          of anger. He punishes those weak of conviction and empowers those who channel rage into action.</li>
        <li><strong>Power & Meritocracy</strong>: He embodies the survival-of-the-fittest ethos: power carved through
          struggle and borne by those who endure. He brooks no excuses or charity; only the strong earn his favor.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Symbols  ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="symbols">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Symbols</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cracked Helm of Thunder</strong>: Forged from storm clouds and lightning, this helm echoes with
          thunder whenever Njord rages.</li>
        <li><strong>Stormcloak of Roaring Gales</strong>: A cloak woven from gale-force winds and vaporous clouds. It
          whips around him in battle, tearing at foes and stirring courage in allies.</li>
        <li><strong>Stormreaver Trident</strong>: A jagged weapon that harnesses wind, sea, and electric fury — calling
          hurricanes or calming catastrophic deluges at his will.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Tenets ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="tenets">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Tenets</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Seize strength in the storm—the sea spares no coward.</li>
        <li>Let anger be your engine, not your master; carve power through trial.</li>
        <li>Earn all you keep—only the proven stand when the gale falls.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Rites & Offerings ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="rites">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Rites</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Siege of Stormkeep</strong>: When Orcs besieged the coastal fortress of Stormkeep, Njord
          unleashed a week-long tempest. Waves battered the walls, lightning shattered siege towers, and only those
          defenders proven in battle earned spared lives. The story ends with the surviving knights swearing oaths under
          thunder to never yield.</li>
        <li><strong>The Trial of the Roaring Shore</strong>: A rite of passage for warriors and sailors. They stand on
          the high cliffs as storms surge around them. Those who hold steady and return victorious are said to have
          Njord’s grit; those who falter are cast out — literally washed away by the returning tide. Those that fail are
          said to rise as 'The Drowned' - an undead creature bound to some Njord for eternity.</li>
        <li><strong>Festival of the Wrathwind</strong>: On the equinoxes, massive bonfires are lit along the coasts.
          Those that build these fires test their skill at keeping the fires alight during the storm. A blessing is said
          to be received - the Storm Kiss - by any who keep their watchfires going until dawn.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Avatars & Interventions ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="avatars">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Avatars</h2>
      <p>Njord is sometimes believed to take the form of great sea monsters even a Merman in order to observe the deeds
        of sailors.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Lore ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="lore">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Lore</h2>
      <p>Beneath the tempest-scorched ruins of an ancient lighthouse, sailors whisper that those struck by lightning
        during the “Oath of the Eye” — swearing unwavering resolve mid-storm — gain Njord’s silent favor. Their vision
        sharpens, able to peer through storm veils and spotting distant foes or hidden coves invisible to others. Yet,
        with each whisper of power, a sliver of their humanity fades, replaced by the distant roar of thunder echoing in
        their minds.</p>
