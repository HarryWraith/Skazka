        <ul class="nodec">
          <li><b>Crown of Dazzling Rays</b>: Forged from pure light, it glimmers like the sun at zenith — an emblem of his boundless
            presence and wisdom.</li>
      
          <li><b>Everlight Orb</b>: A small globe of concentrated sunlight that never dims — its warmth is healing, its glow reveals
            truth, and it can shatter unholy darkness.</li>
      
          <li><b>Radiant Scepter</b>: Topped with a living flame that burns with the warmth of dawn, this staff channels his
            influence whenever light is needed.</li>

        <p>In the mythic pantheon of Skazka, Aeter, the radiant God of Light, reigns as a beacon against encroaching
          darkness — both literal and spiritual. His brilliance brings clarity, hope, and renewal, yet he is neither naive nor
          blind to temptation: true light requires responsibility. As the keeper of the celestial forge, Aeter is revered by
          scholars, healers, and those who seek to banish shadow from the soul.</p>

            <h3>Rites</h3>
      
        <ul class="nodec">
          <li><b>Dawn’s Renewal</b>: At the break of dawn, Sun Elf communities gather in temple courtyards to kindle communal
            Everlight lamps. Each person brings a reflective plate that captures the morning sun before passing it to their
            neighbor — a symbol that light, once shared, grows brighter.</li>
      
          <li><b>The Everlight Trials</b>: Young Sun Elves undergo a trial under Aeter’s observance. They must craft or shape
            something that reflects light  —be it glasswork, art, song, or architecture. Success demonstrates mastery of both
            craft and purpose; failure reminds them that light untended fades.</li>
      
          <li><b>Feast of the Turning</b>: On the summer solstice, temples open every window and let shouts of “Aeter, guide our
            path!” ring out at sunrise. Pilgrims carry candles that burn black smoke which turns godlen in the dawn light.</li>

          <li><b>Illumination & Truth</b>: Aeter is the arbiter of clarity, exposing lies and unveiling hidden things. Scholars
            invoke him in pursuit of knowledge; judges in service of justice.</li>
      
          <li><b>Hope & Renewal</b>: Especially during total darkness — night, winter, loss of faith — his presence reminds the
            pantheon’s followers that morning always returns.</li>
      
          <li><b>Civilization & Artistic Flame</b>: Poets, architects, musicians, and artisans seek inspiration from his glow.
            Creativity flourishes under his favor, pushing civilization ever forward.</li>

            <h3>Lore: The Sunlight Gift & the Birth of the Sun Elves</h3>
            <ul class="nodec">
                <li>
                    Long ago, when dark elven exiles — driven from the Underdark by their own misdeeds — fled upward to the realm
                    of mortals, they were twisted by shadow and despair. Aeter pitying them, reached down and cast a fragment of pure
                    sunlight into their midst: the Everlight.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The infusion of Aeter’s gift altered their essence. Their once-dark skins glowed with a gentle
                    luminescence, their eyes reflecting dawn’s first light. These exiles became the first Sun Elves, noble and fair,
                    dedicated to justice and to spreading light wherever darkness threatens.
                </li>
                      
                        <li>
                Over generations, Sun Elves built grand solar temples, inscribed with stories of Everlight and Aeter’s benevolence.
                  Each dawn, temple priests rekindle their altars with purified sunlight captured at sunrise, ensuring the god’s flame
                  never fades.
                        </li>
