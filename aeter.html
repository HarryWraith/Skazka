      <!-- ===== Overview ===== -->
      <h2 id="overview" class="tb-title">Overview</h2>
      <p>In the mythic pantheon of Skazka, Aeter, the radiant God of Light, reigns as a beacon against encroaching
        darkness — both literal and spiritual. His brilliance brings clarity, hope, and renewal, yet he is neither naive
        nor blind to temptation: true light requires responsibility. As the keeper of the celestial forge, Aeter is
        revered by scholars, healers, and those who seek to banish shadow from the soul.</p>

    <!-- ===== Influence
 ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="domains">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Influence</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Illumination & Truth</strong>: Aeter is the arbiter of clarity, exposing lies and unveiling hidden
          things. Scholars invoke him in pursuit of knowledge; judges in service of justice.</li>
        <li><strong>Hope & Renewal</strong>: Especially during total darkness — night, winter, loss of faith — his
          presence reminds the pantheon’s followers that morning always returns.</li>
        <li><strong>Civilization & Artistic Flame</strong>: Poets, architects, musicians, and artisans seek inspiration
          from his glow. Creativity flourishes under his favor, pushing civilization ever forward.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Symbols & Omens ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="symbols">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Symbols</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Crown of Dazzling Rays</strong>: Forged from pure light, it glimmers like the sun at zenith — an
          emblem of his boundless presence and wisdom.</li>
        <li><strong>Everlight Orb</strong>: A small globe of concentrated sunlight that never dims — its warmth is
          healing, its glow reveals truth, and it can shatter unholy darkness.</li>
        <li><strong>Radiant Scepter</strong>: Topped with a living flame that burns with the warmth of dawn, this staff
          channels his influence whenever light is needed.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Tenets ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="tenets">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Tenets</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Bear the Everlight responsibly—reveal truth without cruelty, and mend what the light uncovers. </li>
        <li>Share your flame: knowledge, craft, and hope grow brighter when passed hand to hand. </li>
        <li>Drive back shadow within and without—renew your vow at dawn and guard the spark at dusk.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Rites & Offerings ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="rites">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Rites</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dawn’s Renewal</strong>: At the break of dawn, Sun Elf communities gather in temple courtyards to
          kindle communal Everlight lamps. Each person brings a reflective plate that captures the morning sun before
          passing it to their neighbor — a symbol that light, once shared, grows brighter.</li>
        <li><strong>The Everlight Trials</strong>: Young Sun Elves undergo a trial under Aeter’s observance. They must
          craft or shape something that reflects light —be it glasswork, art, song, or architecture. Success
          demonstrates mastery of both craft and purpose; failure reminds them that light untended fades.</li>
        <li><strong>Feast of the Turning</strong>: On the summer solstice, temples open every window and let shouts of
          “Aeter, guide our path!” ring out at sunrise. Pilgrims carry candles that burn black smoke which turns godlen
          in the dawn light.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- ===== Avatars & Interventions ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="avatars">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Avatars</h2>
      <p>Not known to take on any other form. Though his followers would suggest his avatar is the sun.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Lore ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="lore">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Lore</h2>
      <p>Long ago, when dark elven exiles — driven from the Underdark by their own misdeeds — fled upward to the realm
        of mortals, they were twisted by shadow and despair. Aeter pitying them, reached down and cast a fragment of
        pure sunlight into their midst: the Everlight.</p>
