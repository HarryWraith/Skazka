      <p>
        Some say Ioun’s ascension began not with ambition but with
        desperation. As a mortal priestess, she served in a crumbling world
        where time itself was unraveling, the sky bleeding into tomorrow and
        yesterday. In her search for answers, she uncovered a fragment of
        forbidden scripture that spoke of Kronos, the Titan of Time,
        imprisoned beyond the veil of mortal reckoning. When she dared to read
        the words aloud, she caught his attention—not with worship, but with
        comprehension. Kronos touched her mind to test if she could bear a
        glimpse of eternity, and in that instant she ceased to be wholly
        human. Her flesh unraveled into thought, her heartbeat into memory,
        and when the transformation ended, she stood as something more: the
        keeper of knowledge and seer of what may come, no longer bound by the
        thread of time she once feared.

          <b>Divination and fate</b>: Her gaze pierces veils of time, offering

          Legends say Ioun never spoke again after Kronos touched her; all her
          words are now carried as whispers in the dreams of seekers.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is told she still walks the ruins of dying worlds, leaving
          cryptic writings on stone walls for those wise enough to find them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Myths warn that every true revelation from Ioun comes with a hidden
          cost: knowledge exchanged for memory, certainty purchased with
          doubt.
