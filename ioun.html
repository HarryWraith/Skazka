      <!-- ===== Overview ===== -->
      <h2 id="overview" class="tb-title">Overview</h2>
      <p>Some say Ioun’s ascension began not with ambition but with desperation. As a mortal priestess, she served in a
        crumbling world where time itself was unraveling, the sky bleeding into tomorrow and yesterday. In her search
        for answers, she uncovered a fragment of forbidden scripture that spoke of Kronos, the Titan of Time, imprisoned
        beyond the veil of mortal reckoning. When she dared to read the words aloud, she caught his attention—not with
        worship, but with comprehension. Kronos touched her mind to test if she could bear a glimpse of eternity, and in
        that instant she ceased to be wholly human. Her flesh unraveled into thought, her heartbeat into memory, and
        when the transformation ended, she stood as something more: the keeper of knowledge and seer of what may come,
        no longer bound by the thread of time she once feared.</p>

    <!-- ===== Influence
 ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="domains">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Influence</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Knowledge and memory</strong>: She preserves what would otherwise be forgotten, holding the wisdom
          of mortals and gods alike.</li>
        <li><strong>Divination and fate</strong>: Her gaze pierces veils of time, offering glimpses of what may come —
          though never with certainty.</li>
        <li><strong>Ruins and lost truths</strong>: Her followers scour fallen civilizations and forgotten places,
          believing her presence lingers where the past has crumbled.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Symbols  ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="symbols">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Symbols</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The shattered hourglass</strong>: Sand spilling upward as much as downward, representing her mastery
          of past and future as one.</li>
        <li><strong>The open eye in a tome</strong>: A stylized eye drawn upon a half-open book, symbolizing insight
          through study and revelation.</li>
        <li><strong>The spiral of stairs</strong>: A curling pattern of constellations, said to reflect the infinite
          pathways of fate.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Tenets ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="tenets">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Tenets</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Guard every shard of knowledge—ruined tablets, corrupted memories, half-legends. Compile before you judge.
          To destroy lore is a sin; to preserve even a sliver is devotion.</li>
        <li>Keep the eye open. Record what is, not what is comfortable. Expose falsehoods, name patterns in the dark,
          and accept contradiction until the evidence resolves.</li>
        <li>Chart the constellations of possibility and speak what may be, but never chain a soul to prophecy. Guidance
          is sacred; coercion is heresy.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Rites & Offerings ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="rites">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Rites</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The vigil of the lamp</strong>: Devotees keep a lamp burning from dusk until dawn while reading
          aloud from old texts, inviting Ioun to grant sudden flashes of insight.</li>
        <li><strong>The casting of shards</strong>: Fragments of broken glass or crystal are scattered on cloth, their
          patterns interpreted as visions or omens.</li>
        <li><strong>The rite of whispered names</strong>: Followers softly speak the names of ancestors and forgotten
          figures into the night air, offering memory as sacrifice to keep the goddess strong.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="tb-panel" id="lore">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Lore</h2>
      <p>
      <p>Legends say Ioun never spoke again after Kronos touched her; all her words are now carried as whispers in the
        dreams of seekers.</p>
      <p>It is told she still walks the ruins of dying worlds, leaving cryptic writings on stone walls for those wise
        enough to find them.</p>
      <p>Myths warn that every true revelation from Ioun comes with a hidden cost: knowledge exchanged for memory,
        certainty purchased with doubt. </p>
