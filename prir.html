      <div>
        <p>They walk among ruins and riches, memories and myths — gods who were once human. The Prir, known as the
          Walking Gods,
          are not born divine but become divine. Some ascended through great deeds or deep wisdom. Others stumbled into
          godhood by sheer chance, cruel fate, or cosmic whim. A few were elevated as reward, others as punishment. The
          universe, it seems, has a sense of humor.</p>
        <p>No two Prir are alike. Some are benevolent protectors, lighting the way for their followers. Others are
          unpredictable, vengeful, or wholly indifferent to mortal concerns. Some still whisper to their worshipers,
          guide
          kings, or stir the wind over battlefields. Others have vanished into silence, lost in their own eternity.</p>
        <p>Yet all share one truth: their power is not infinite. It ebbs and flows with the devotion of those who
          believe.
          Worship is the lifeblood of a Prir. Shrines, prayers, songs, and sacrifices feed their essence. A forgotten
          god is a
          fading god. A beloved one burns like a star.</p>
        <p>To understand the Prir is to understand the heights and failings of mortal existence itself — magnified,
          eternal, and walking
          still.</p>

      <h2>Chernabog</h2>
      <p class="sub">God of misfortune and corruption. Patron to the downtrodden</p>
      <blockquote>"I am not your punishment. I am what comes when you pretend the world is just."</blockquote>
      <p>Among all the Prir and twisted divines that haunt Skazka’s mythic past, Chernabog is the shadow cast by hope
        itself. Once a forsaken mortal, cursed by fate or Kaos itself, he became god not by ascension, but through
        corruption, hatred, and the mockery of divine pity. Chernabog is misfortune made incarnate: cold, inevitable,
        and
        patient.</p>

      <h3>Symbols</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>The Blighted Eye</b>: A cracked, blackened eye weeping ash—seen etched on cursed altars, hidden in
          desperate
          places.</li>
        <li><b>Withered Tree</b>: Once lush, now hollow and lifeless. Often carved where misfortune lingers long.</li>
        <li><b>The Eclipse Halo</b>: A black circle around a pale disc—an eternal reminder of his birth beneath a dying
          sun.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Domains</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Misfortune</b>: Wherever luck turns bitter and triumphs collapse, Chernabog walks unseen.</li>
        <li><b>Despair</b>: Not raw destruction, but carefully sown ruin—turning hope to ash and bonds to blades.</li>
        <li><b>Corruption</b>: He is not the chaos of Kaos, but its precision; a seed of rot planted in systems and
          souls.
        </li>
        <li><b>Creation of Monsters</b>: From his rage, he forged the orcs—brutal reflections of his own exile.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Rites</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>The Mask of Ruin</b>: Said to be worn by Chernabog when walking among mortals. It bears no eyes, only a
          faint
          smile. It is now a symbol worn by priests of this deity.</li>
        <li><b>Ashblade</b>: A sword carried by his earliest orc warlords, forged from volcanic glass and regret. It
          breaks
          not bodies, but loyalty. Said to be used to ordain priests in to the ranks of Chernabog.</li>
        <li><b>The Thousand Whispers</b>: A forbidden prayer spoken only by those who have lost everything. The prayer
          does
          not ask for aid — it asks for vengeance through entropy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Lore</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>The Founding of the First Orc</b>: Beneath the Dead Peak, Chernabog shaped the first orc from stone, ash,
          and raw will. He did not gift them purpose — he gave them anger. Their hearts burn with echoes of Chernabog’s
          first scream.</li>
        <li><b>The Ashfall War</b>: When the orcs flooded from his sanctum, no god knew where the tide would end. Cities
          vanished beneath choking smoke. Chernabog himself never lifted a blade — he whispered, and kings tore down
          their own
          thrones.</li>
        <li><b>The Banishment</b>: The Annarr, unified in fear, shattered Chernabog’s name, divided his orc legions, and
          sealed his sanctum. For a thousand years his name was erased from stone, song, and prayer. But misfortune does
          not
          sleep.</li>
        <li><b>Worship & Fear</b>: Chernabog is not worshipped openly. His name is muttered only by the
          broken—prisoners,
          the plague-touched, exiled warlords. Secret cults called The Hollowed Eye plant despair deliberately,
          believing
          that only ruin brings truth.</li>

      <h2>Herukan</h2>
      <p class="sub">God of song, memory and revelation. Patron to bards.</p>
      <blockquote>"Every silence is a cage. I do not break it—I sing until the bars forget they were meant to hold."</blockquote>
      
      <p>
        Born in the shadowed alleys of Varn Hollow under a blood moon, Herukan, a gnome with hauntingly large eyes and
        nimble fingers, was sold to the Carnival of the Shrieking Bell by his parents who could not afford to raise him.
        Amid cruelty and fractured instruments, he learned to
        channel sorrow through his harp-like voice. One night, after a brutal beating, his lament awake a Shard of
        Uzume, an
        ancient fragment of song-power buried in nearby for thousands of years. The shard fused with his soul, and in
        his next performance, time itself stopped. Herukan, through no choice of his own,
        ascended and became god of song and emotional transformation — one who sings and the world obeys.
      </p>
      <h3>Symbols</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>The Shattered Bell</b>: A cracked handbell, often worn as a pendant. It represents the broken silence
          Herukan shattered with
          his song at the carnival of the Shrieking Bell. Worshippers never ring it—only wear it. To ring it is to beg
          for a voice
          in the silence of despair. </li>
        <li><b>“When silence hurts, I listen.”</b>: Whispered creed of Herukan’s faithful.</li>
        <li><b>The Spiral Harp</b> :An impossible harp whose strings spiral into infinity. Appears in murals and
          frescoes. Used as an emblem by bardic orders aligned with Herukan’s truth-driven music.</li>
        <li><b>The Mask with No Mouth:</b> A simple theatre mask with no mouth, only expressive eye slits. A symbol of
          those who were never
          heard. Carried by orphans, the exiled, and abused performers. When a follower sings
          with it placed beside them, it’s said Herukan sings in harmony.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Domains</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Song & Emotion</b>: His voice commands tears and ecstasy, weaving potent emotional resonance into all who
          hear him.</li>
        <li><b>Memory & Loss</b>: He gives form to grief, unlocks nostalgia, and binds memory with melody.</li>
        <li><b>Revelation & Truth</b>: In his harmonies, hidden truths surface; lies unravel to silence.</li>
        <li><b>Veil & Inter-Realm Chorus</b>: Herukan bridges realms, warping reality through sound.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Rites</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>The Blood-Moon Lament</b>: During lunar eclipses, gnome bards perform low dirges in acoustic chambers. As
          tears flow, they believe Herukan listens — rekindling empathy in a world grown harsh.
        </li>
      
        <li>
          <b>Carnival’s Silence</b>: Displaced performers hang broken instruments at doorways. Once silent, they are
          never played again — tokens of respect for
          the night Herukan’s song turned sorrow into cosmic pause.
        </li>
      
        <li>
          Shard-Adaptive Hymn: melodies are sung in layered counterpoint until the air quivers. When done
          correctly, singers claim to feel doorways open beyond mortal perception.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Lore</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>The Night of the Eclipsed Strings</b>: Long after his ascension, Herukan returned in secret to Varn Hollow,
          wearing the Mask with No Mouth. The city had outlawed music—its ruler fearing that melody might stir rebellion. On
          the night of a rare double eclipse, Herukan stood beneath the gallows where the last street-bard had been executed
          and plucked a single note on an unseen instrument. The sound did not reach ears—it reached memories.
          Every soul in the city remembered their first song, their first dance, their first whispered lullaby. The silence
          laws shattered not through protest, but through an uncontrollable chorus as every citizen began to hum at once. It
          is said the ruler tore out his own tongue that night, unable to bear the truth Herukan’s note had forced him to
          face.
        </li>
        <li>
        <b>The Seven Harmonies of Forgetting</b>: In the Age of Glass Thrones, a great plague spread—not of body, but of mind.
        Victims lost their memories, living as hollow shells. Desperate healers turned to Herukan’s followers, who recalled an
        ancient rite known as the Seven Harmonies of Forgetting. Paradoxically, the cure came not from restoring memory, but
        by letting go of pain so deep it shackled the mind.
        For seven nights, masked choirs sang each harmony, one per night, while walking through the streets with Shattered
        Bells around their necks. Each harmony dissolved a layer of sorrow until, on the seventh night, the afflicted awoke
        with tears on their faces, able to recall their names once more. They had not recovered all their memories—only the
        ones worth keeping.      
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The Harp that Caught the Sky</b>: Bardic tradition speaks of a single performance in the Court of Dawn when
          Herukan, challenged by a rival god of silence, strung the Spiral Harp with threads of light pulled from the morning
          sun. Each note captured a fragment of the sky, and with every chord, stars appeared where there should have been
          daylight. The god of silence, unprepared for beauty that did not require words, withdrew from the mortal realm for a hundred
          years. Followers of Herukan still believe that on certain mornings, if you look closely at the sunrise, you can see
          faint spiral strings reaching upward, resonating with the echo of that impossible performance.

      <h2>Mortifer</h2>
      <p class="sub">Lord of murder and ambition. Patron to assassins and serial killers.</p>
      <blockquote>“A blade, a name, a silence. This is his prayer.” — from the banned Velkarian Catechism of Knives
      </blockquote>
      <p>Mortifer was born beneath the counting-houses of Velkaria, ignored even by his own lineage. He watched as
        brothers
        inherited, sisters were adored, and his father spoke only of legacy — never his. His first kill was not rage,
        but
        experiment. The next, calculation. Then came artistry. As the bodies fell and his family's line crumbled,
        Mortifer’s
        name rose like smoke over a ruined ledger. But even wealth and titles could not still his hunger. He turned to
        the
        forbidden: blood sorcery, exile-born rites, the carving of power into flesh.</p>

      <p>On a night soaked in red moonlight, Mortifer killed the city’s entire merchant council — thirteen blades,
        thirteen
        names, thirteen deaths in one breath. When dawn broke, he stood alone amidst chaos, not merely feared but
        revered. The
        divine took notice — not to bless him, but to acknowledge him. With each murder done in ambition, his essence
        deepened.
        With each assassin’s whisper, his shadow lengthened.</p>

      <p>He is now worshipped in silence, invoked without voice. No church dares claim him — and yet every assassin,
        every
        traitor, every power-hungry soul knows his mark. He is the god of murder not as madness, but as method.</p>


      <h3>Symbols</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>A nod and a wink</b>: A blood-slick dagger plunged into a coin; this is the calling card of those who
          serve Mortifer.</li>
        <li><b>A dire warning</b>: a severed hand clutching thirteen black threads; this is the symbol which indicates
          refuge is close-by for those who follow the Lord of Murder.</li>
        <li><b>Guess whose coming to dinner</b>: a tarot card with a red crescent moon biting through darkness; a gift
          given to those a devotee intends on killing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Domains</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Planned to perfection</b>: Mortifier is not just about murder, but murder which is planned immactulately.
        </li>
        <li><b>Slay thy borother</b>: ambition above everything else. Even family should not be above scheming.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Rites</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><b>The Rite of Thirteen</b>: A ritual killing involving thirteen symbolic elements — thirteen blades,
          thirteen heartbeats, thirteen names whispered. Said to draw Mortifer's gaze directly and confer dark favor or
          protection in exchange for the killer’s own soul fraying.</li>

        <li><b>Velkarian Marking</b>: Practitioners slice the rune of Mortifer — an angular glyph resembling a dagger
          through an eye — into their skin before committing a murder-for-power. Done properly, the mark never scars,
          only deepens.</li>
        <img 
        class="popup"
        src="assets/mortifer_rune.jpg" alt="">

        <li><b>The Crimson Silence</b>: A vow taken by assassins, never to speak of the act once done. Each broken vow
          supposedly awakens a fragment of Mortifer within, leading to madness or worse — divine possession.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Lore</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Mortifer was not born divine</b>: he proved himself divine. In the mercantile sprawl of Velkaria, where
          merchants bartered souls and family was priced in ledgers, he was a forgotten child: the seventh son, the
          unmentioned heir. But Mortifer did not beg for legacy. He seized it, body by body, crime by crime, blade by
          blade. His murders were not acts of madness — they were assertions of order, deliberate, ritualistic,
          inevitable.</li>

        <li><b>He rose by subtraction</b>: thinning the world of his rivals until only he remained. The gods took notice
          when mortals fled from his shadow rather than from theirs. They watched as he carved divinity into himself —
          not through worship, but through work.</li>

        <li><b>He has no temples, only scenes of crime</b></li>: His sermons are written in bloodstains. His hymns are
        final breaths.

        <li><b>The Ledger of Unspoken Names</b>: A tattered book said to list every name Mortifer has claimed. No ink,
          only impressions — names felt rather than read.</li>

        <li><b>The Dagger of Final Inheritance</b>: A black-bladed relic believed to be the very knife used to slay the
          merchant council. It thirsts audibly when near betrayal.</li>

        <li><b>The Silence-Bound Psalms</b>: Etched onto bone, readable only under blood-moonlight. Reciting one is said
          to hide a murderer from all gods — save Mortifer.</li>

      <h2>Agos</h2>
      <p class="sub">God of farming, agriculture and the seasons. Patron to farmers and anyone who works on the land.</p>
      <blockquote>“Turn the soil with respect, for every furrow is a promise. Tend with patience, reap with gratitude, and know that what you take today you must give back tomorrow.”</blockquote>
      <p>Agos, the hulking god of farming and agriculture, stands as a sentinel over the soil and its stewards. Often
        portrayed as a muscular, earth-streaked farmer wielding a broad scythe, he embodies the sweat and strength
        required to coax bounty from the land. He was especially revered by the Sken, the hardy folk who migrated from Skia to Kelos
        centuries ago, bringing with them veneration for Agos and integrating his worship deeply into their agrarian
        culture.

        <li><b>Breaking the first furrow</b>: At spring’s first plowing, farmers dedicate the fresh earth, sprinkling
          seed and wine at Agos’s shrine, invoking his blessing.</li>

        <li><b>Mid-Summer Scythe Blessing</b>: Villagers ceremonially sharpen scythes and pass them near a hearth fire,
          offering tobacco or sweet grain to ensure a swift harvest.</li>

        <li><b>Harvest Feast (“Agos’ Abundance”)</b>: A communal celebration at harvest’s end with bread shaped like
          earthen mounds, singing of toil and thanks, and the first sheaf carried in procession to the temple.</li>
        <li><b>Stubble blessing</b>: After harvest, participants leap over burned stubble while singing an old chant to
          cleanse any lingering pestilence.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Lore</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>The Sken Pilgrimage</b>: Legend tells of a migration from Skia to Kelos, where floods and famine once
          struck the early Sken settlements. A humble farmer named Khelan prayed to Agos, and by sunrise, the clouds parted,
          revealing fertile land. The Sken built an altar on a grassy ridge where Khelan first sowed seed in Kelos, and
          for generations, every new settlement began with that same rite.</li>

        <li><b>The Tale of the Iron Field</b>: A rich landowner, hoping to expand his domain, cursed a field, believing
          he could control Agos’s bounty with iron spikes. Crops failed, cattle sickened, and his family fell into
          despair — until a peasant girl, Marisa, removed the spikes and reburied them deep in the earth. With that act of
          humility, Agos restored the field, teaching that reverence outweighs dominion over the land’s spirit.</li>

        <li><b>The Trials of the Green Scythe</b>: Agos once walked as a mortal among farmers, testing their hearts. He
          lent a green-hilted scythe to three brothers, instructing them to harvest their own plots. The first two
          brothers ignored the soil’s needs and cut swiftly — the yield was poor and blighted. The youngest brother, however,
          cleaned the field, prayed for the blade’s guidance, and worked patiently. When he finished, his scythe glowed
          with verdant light and his yield overflowed. Agos revealed himself, granting the farmer lifelong

      <h2>Silithus</h2>
      <p class="sub">God of deception and secrets. Patron to spies and illusionists. </p>
      <blockquote>“Trust not the silver tongue that weaves such honeyed lies, for beneath each word lies another face.”</blockquote>
      <p>Silithus, once a mortal of striking beauty and cunning wit, ascended to divinity through Kaos’s dark grace.
        Whispers say his ambition caught the primordial’s eye — Kaos saw in him the perfect vessel for deception. Now known as
        Silithus, God of Lies and Deception, he presides over secrets, illusions, and the art of masks. Though remarkably
        charismatic, half of his visage is scarred by holy flame — a cruel reminder of his former humanity and the powers he
        wields.</p>
    
      <h3>Symbols</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Two-faced mask</b>: One side smooth and serene, the other grotesquely burned—symbolizes duality of truth and
          falsehood.</li>
        <li><b>Burned Quill</b>: An inkwell’s feather scorched at the nib, emblematic of writing false deeds and signing
          secret pacts.</li>

        <li><b>Deception and illusion</b>: The forging and weaving of lies.</li>
        <li><b>Masks & Transformation</b>: Facilitating literal and metaphoric shape-shifting.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <h3>Rites</h3>
    
      <ul>
        <li><b>Veiling the truth</b>: Spies and informants gather under moonlight, each donning dual masks—half pristine,
          half charred—to honor Silithus’s fractured face. A contract is written in disappearing ink; once read and bound,
          participants whisper their secret lies into a copper bowl and burn the text, sealing their deceit.</li>
    
        <li><b>Trial by mirror</b>: Initiates stand before smoky mirrors recounting their greatest falsehood. The mirror’s
          surface cracks if the deceit is profound, revealing a deeper hidden image beneath.</li>
    
        <li><b>Embrace the flames</b>: In sacred temples, acolytes hold live candles to half their own faces; the wax burns
          symbolize solidarity with Silithus’s scarred half and devotion to truth’s darker twin.</li>
    
      </ul>
    
      <h3>Lore</h3>
      <p>In his mortal life, Silithus was a nobleman renowned for beauty and charm, celebrated for his hypnotic eloquence.
        But envy bred ambition — his hunger for influence led him to trafficing in court intrigue, spreading whispers that
        toppled kings and built his own power.</p>
    
      <p>When Kaos observed these machinations, he deemed Silithus a kindred spirit and offered divinity. The ceremony was
        brutal: the flames of Kaos engulfed half of his face, searing flesh and binding his soul to primordial deceit.
        Though scarred, Silithus emerged divine, eyes now glimmering with infinite cunning.</p>
    
      <p>As a god, he built an empire of shadows: secret guilds, spy networks that stretch across realms, and hidden temples
        behind false walls. His followers include intelligence brokers, master spies, illusionists, and those who thrive in
        the murk between truth and lie.</p>
    
      <p>Yet Silithus remains a paradox. While he champions lies, he values honesty among his own — betrayal within his cult
        is punished worse than death. They say he can read truth through silence, unraveling the most elaborate deceptions
        with a single glance. His temples are silent labyrinths where whispered secrets echo eternally; those who wander in
        uninvited often unravel their own minds.</p>

      <h2>Leonarah</h2>
      <p class="sub">Goddess of war, conflict and battle. Patron to soldiers and gladiators.</p>
      <blockquote>"Steel breaks, flesh rots, but the will to stand is eternal — fight, and I shall know your name."
      </blockquote>
      <p>Leonarah was born daughter of Aderion Vey, a merchant-lord whose
        caravans brought silk, gold, and rare ironwood across half the known world. Her childhood was gilded, her days
        filled with
        the music of foreign minstrels and the scent of cinnamon from far ports. But when civil war split the empire
        in two, her father refused the Emperor’s summons, sending neither coin nor sword to the throne. For this defiance,
        he
        was executed in the public square, his body left for the carrion birds. Leonarah’s ancestral manors were seized, her
        ships burned, and she herself sold into the slave pits of Virethane. There, in the blood-soaked sand, she learned
        the
        art of killing, rising from a nameless captive to the arena’s undefeated champion, called The Crimson Mantle for the
        cloak she wore woven from her own fallen foes’ banners. Her fame grew until whispers reached the palace itself —
        whispers of a warrior who fought like a storm given form. On the day she faced the Emperor in his private arena, her
        spear found his heart, ending his reign. But as prophecy had long foretold, her victory demanded the price of her
        life; she fell moments later, her blood mingling with his upon the marble floor. In death, the gods of strife
        claimed
        her, and the people began to pray to Leonarah — the mortal who defied an empire, now immortal patroness of warriors
        who rise from ruin to glory.</p>

      <p>They say Surrana was once the most desired courtesan in all the realms, her beauty so sharp it cut kings and beggars
        alike. Yet desire is a fickle thing, and when she spurned the advances of a high priest, he cursed her with a hunger
        that no touch could sate. For years, she wandered through flesh and passion like a starving wolf, until the night she
        found herself at a shrine to some long dead power. Silently, she offered it the last thing she owned — her mortal soul — 
        if only to end her pain. Whoever or whatever it was accepted the gift. In return Surrana

      <h2>Cormarin</h2>
      <p class="sub">God of pain and self-loathing</p>
      <blockquote>“Let them betray you, let them scorn you; I dwell not in their mercy, but in the hollow echo of their regret. Pain is my altar, and self-loathing my crown.”</blockquote>
      <p>Once a cunning archdevil in the infernal hierarchy, Cormarin’s mortal origins are shrouded in rumor, whispered in
        dark corners of the planes: he was a man who first tasted the sting of betrayal and, in that crucible, discovered a
        hunger for power stronger than loyalty. In life, he wove schemes so intricate that even his infernal masters envied
        them, but his ambition outstripped his cunning—he sought not servitude but dominion. Cast from the Nine Hells for
        plotting to enslave a legion of devils, his soul, fragmented and burning with resentment, seeped into the dreamscape,
        twisting itself around mortal fears and sorrows. Each whispered nightmare, each sleepless night, fed his essence until
        mortals began to feel his presence even when asleep. Pain and self-loathing, once personal afflictions, became divine
        instruments, and through the collective anguish of those who scorned his followers, Cormarin ascended—not through
        worship, but through the very suffering he had mastered, forging a god from a devil and a man’s darkest torment.</p>

      <p>Once, she was a shadow among shadows, a mortal thief whose fingers stole coin and whispers with equal ease. One night, chasing a secret rumored to unmake kings, she found herself at the edge of a forgotten temple, where a dying god murmured riddles of power and oblivion.

When she claimed his final breath, the world fractured beneath her will, and the shadows she had once walked through began to bend and whisper to her.

      <h2>Than</h2>
      <p class="sub">Champion of the wood and nature's avenger. Patron and protector of Ku'Than.</p>
      <blockquote>"Let the trees bear witness, for those who scar the sacred earth shall find no mercy in my shadow." —
        Than
      </blockquote>
      <p>Than, the ancient and enigmatic forest deity of Skazka, is a primal force of nature whose worship predates most
        known religions in the world. Revered almost exclusively within the mysterious woodland realm of Ku’Than, Than
        embodies the untamed spirit of the earth, meting out merciless vengeance on those who defile the sacred Elden
        Wood.
        Oft depicted as a horned figure with a face that communes through trees, Than’s presence is deeply felt rather
        than
        widely seen. Her priests and priestesses, known simply as Witches, are nurtured from childhood and tested
        through a
        brutal rite of survival before earning their place as guardians of the forest. Governed by the secretive Council
        of
        Than and led by High Witch Serona, the people of Ku’Than live in harmony with nature’s harsh order, believing
        their
        living forest to be both sanctuary and sentinel — perhaps even a prison to some ancient force. Outside their
        dark
        and
        shifting woods, Than’s influence is rare, yet when a Witch emerges, it is a sign that something of great
        consequence
        stirs within the green heart of Skazka.</p>
      <h3>Symbols</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>A Branched Tree with a Face</b>: Explicitly described as her holy symbol, this image captures her
          communion
          with followers through the forest itself and reflects her embodiment of the sentient wilderness.</li>

        <li><b>Antlers</b>: Than is often depicted with antlered horns, symbolizing primal power, wilderness, and her
          kinship with untamed creatures.</li>

        <li><b>Twisted Vines or Roots</b>: Representing the deep, binding force of nature and the hidden strength
          beneath
          the surface, they may also reflect the inescapable reach of her influence.</li>

        <li><b>The Forest Itself (Elden Wood)</b>: Not a traditional symbol, but emblematic of her essence—living,
          shifting,
          ancient, and sacred. Stylized forest motifs or silhouettes might appear in her iconography.</li>

        <li><b>Tree Bark Mask</b>: Worn by her followers, this might symbolize the merging of identity
          with the forest and Than's spirit.</li>

        <li><b>Coven Rings or Interlocking Circles</b>: Representing the sacred bonds between witches and their
          apprentices,
          and the unity (and fatal link) within her faithful.</li>
      </ul>


      <h3>domains</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Nature</b>: Central to her worship, Than is deeply tied to the forest, the earth, and the preservation of
          the
          natural
          world. Her followers revere untouched wilderness and act as its fierce protectors.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Vengeance</b>: Than is described as uncompromising and intolerant of those who defile nature. Her Witches
          actively seek
          retribution against violators, suggesting this as a core aspect of her divine power.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Mystery or Secrets</b>: The shrouded, ever-shifting forest and the little-known inner workings of Ku’Than
          point
          to a
          domain over secrecy, hidden knowledge, or the unknown.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Fate or Trials</b>: The demanding trials for becoming a Witch, and the idea that not all survive, may hint
          that
          Than
          oversees tests of worth, destiny, or the forging of strength through adversity.

          The Weird (mentor Witch) performs a secretive ritual
          at a sacred glade, marking the child with earth and sap to symbolize their rebirth into the forest’s will. The
          child
          is introduced to the spirits of the woods, often through dream or trance induced by herbal smoke, and given a
          seed
          to
          plant — their first pact with Than.

          <b>Trial of Root and Shadow (Coming of Age)</b>
          At the age of maturity, Witchlings undergo a solitary survival ordeal: one year and one day alone in the Elden
          Wood.
          During this time, they must endure its dangers, earn the forest’s respect, and avoid becoming prey to both
          beast
          and
          spirit. Survival is seen as Than’s personal approval; failure often means death — or worse, transformation
          into
          something unnatural.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Than'Dva (Witch-Pairing Ritual)</b>: Upon becoming a full Witch, the initiate is ritually bound to a
          covenant-partner in a ceremony within a sacred cave known as the Sanctuary of Revelations.
          The two Witches, naked and submerged in the pool, must share their most intimate secrets. They are then
          visited by
          the spirts of their ancestors who bless
          and sponsor the bonding. Their fates are joined, their lives entwined — one cannot survive the other’s death.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The Vengeance Harvest</b>: When someone defiles the forest, a coven may perform this rite under moonlight.
          Witches gather around a tree bearing a
          face of Than and invoke her fury through chanting, blood-letting, and binding effigies made from the
          violator’s
          discarded items. The rite often precedes a hunt — literal or spiritual — in which nature exacts retribution.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Rite of the Twisting Paths (Divination)</b>: This secretive rite is used to commune with Than or seek
          guidance.
          A Witch enters the forest alone,
          ingesting sacred herbs, and follows an animal or tree spirit until a vision is granted. The forest itself
          becomes
          the altar, the voice,
          and the veil between worlds.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Burial by the Roots</b>: When a Witch dies, their body is not burned or entombed but returned to the
          forest.
          They are buried in fetal position
          beneath a young sapling, believed to carry their spirit forward. A mask or symbol of their covenant may be
          hung
          from
          the branches, marking their passage and presence in the trees.

          <b>The Withering of Seroth Hollow:</b> Long ago, on the western edge of the Elden Wood, there was a thriving
          lumber village called Seroth Hollow. Nestled
          dangerously close to the border of Ku’Than, its people grew bold with their axes and trade, felling ancient
          trees
          whispered to be older than the gods. Despite warnings etched into bark, the villagers pressed deeper into the
          sacred
          groves.
          One night, the forest went silent. No wind, no birds, no life. The next morning, Seroth Hollow was gone. Not
          burned, not razed — gone.
          In its place, a hollow depression in the earth stretched like a wound, filled with twisted roots that groaned
          with
          the
          sounds of human voices. The only sign of the village was a single, towering tree in the center, its bark
          etched
          with
          dozens of human faces frozen in expressions of terror. The Witches of Than call it The Tree of Regret, and
          they
          say
          each face is a soul bound to bark for eternity — not dead, not alive, but listening, eternally aware, feeding
          the
          tree’s
          hunger for vengeance.
          To this day, no birds fly above that place, and no creature sets foot there. Familiars warn Witchlings never
          to
          approach it alone, for the tree whispers in the voice of those it has consumed, calling for help in familiar
          tones. Some who
          answer never return. Others do — hollow-eyed, their voices splintered and sap dripping from their mouths.
          It is said that the Tree of Regret is a fragment of Than’s wrath made manifest — a punishment not for one
          crime,
          but
          for forgetting that the forest is older, crueler, and more sacred than man will ever be.

      <h2>Ioun</h2>
      <p class="sub">Goddess of knowledge and divination.</p>
      <blockquote>“Do not seek certainty in what lies ahead—seek clarity. The future is no stone path, but a river: it bends, it breaks, it floods. To know is not to master, but to choose where you will stand when the waters rise.”</blockquote>
      <p>Some say Ioun’s ascension began not with ambition but with desperation. As a mortal priestess, she served in a crumbling world where time itself was unraveling, the sky bleeding into tomorrow and yesterday. In her search for answers, she uncovered a fragment of forbidden scripture that spoke of Cronos, the Titan of Time, imprisoned beyond the veil of mortal reckoning. When she dared to read the words aloud, she caught his attention—not with worship, but with comprehension. Cronos touched her mind to test if she could bear a glimpse of eternity, and in that instant she ceased to be wholly human. Her flesh unraveled into thought, her heartbeat into memory, and when the transformation ended, she stood as something more: the keeper of knowledge and seer of what may come, no longer bound by the thread of time she once feared.</p>

      <p class="sub"> Lunica is the goddess of shapechangers, hunting and betrayal. At endless war with her brother, Mani.</p>    
      <blockquote>“Trust is the sweetest meat, and I always strike when the heart is fullest.”</blockquote>
      <p>Lunica was said to be a huntress who thrived not by strength, but by cunning. Some stories claim she betrayed her hunting band, shifting her form into wolf, crow, and shadow to escape their vengeance. Others whisper she discovered the “true names” of beasts and men, allowing her to wear their flesh like a cloak. When she betrayed her final kin—her own brother Mani—Cronos or another cosmic power marked her with divine wrath, but instead of punishment, the mantle of divinity clung to her treachery. Now she hunts across worlds, ever-changing, ever-hungry, locked in endless war with Mani, who curses what she consumes and protects those she would betray.</p>

        <li>Some myths say Lunica betrayed Mani in life before godhood, stealing his prey and twisting his curses back upon him, which began their eternal feud.</li>
        <li>It is believed she wears a different form each night, and anyone met in the wild after dusk might be Lunica in disguise.</li>

      <h2>Mani</h2>
      <p class="sub">Mani is the god of the cursed, curses, damned and downtrodden. Eternally at war with his sister, Lunica.</p>    
      <blockquote>“I am the breath of every oath broken, the wound that festers, the shadow that never heals. Call to me, and I will answer.”</blockquote>
      <p>Mani was once a man broken by betrayal — some say Lunica’s betrayal, others say the world’s. He was marked, cast aside, left to die, but instead of death, the curses of the forsaken rose around him like a crown. He took them all upon himself — the hatred of the abandoned, the rage of the maimed, the despair of the downtrodden — and with them, he became something more than mortal. If Lunica ascended through the power of betrayal, Mani ascended through the agony of survival. He is the eternal victim turned eternal avenger.</p>

       <h3>Symbols</h3>

        <li><b>The ashen brand</b>: A ring of concentric scar-marks around a hollow center, like a burn that never heals; used as a curse-seal pressed into wax, skin, or stone.</li>

        <li><b>The curse feast</b>: A ritual meal is left to rot deliberately, then buried or burned, symbolizing the devotion of the lowly to Mani’s endless hunger.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Lore</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Every scar and wound Mani bears is said to be the curse of a mortal made flesh, carried by him so their suffering might echo forever.</li>
        <li>He is locked in eternal war with Lunica, not only because she betrayed him, but because every betrayal feeds his power.</li>
        <li>Those who suffer injustice or cruelty whisper prayers to Mani, believing that curses spoken in his name always find their mark.</li>
