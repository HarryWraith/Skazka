          <p>They walk among ruins and riches, memories and myths — gods who were once human. The Prir, known as the Walking Gods,
            are not born divine but become divine. Some ascended through great deeds or deep wisdom. Others stumbled into
            godhood by sheer chance, cruel fate, or cosmic whim. A few were elevated as reward, others as punishment. The
            universe, it seems, has a sense of humor.</p>
          <p>No two Prir are alike. Some are benevolent protectors, lighting the way for their followers. Others are
            unpredictable, vengeful, or wholly indifferent to mortal concerns. Some still whisper to their worshipers, guide
            kings, or stir the wind over battlefields. Others have vanished into silence, lost in their own eternity.</p>
          <p>Yet all share one truth: their power is not infinite. It ebbs and flows with the devotion of those who believe.
            Worship is the lifeblood of a Prir. Shrines, prayers, songs, and sacrifices feed their essence. A forgotten god is a
            fading god. A beloved one burns like a star.</p>
          <p>To understand the Prir is to understand the heights and failings of mortal existence itself — magnified, eternal, and walking
            still.</p>

        <h2>Chernabog</h2>
        <blockquote>"I am not your punishment. I am what comes when you pretend the world is just."</blockquote>
        <p>Among all the Annarr and twisted divines that haunt Skazka’s mythic past, Chernabog is the shadow cast by hope
          itself. Once a forsaken mortal, cursed by fate or Kaos itself, he became god not by ascension—but through
          corruption, hatred, and the mockery of divine pity. Chernabog is misfortune made incarnate: cold, inevitable, and
          patient.</p>
      
        <h3>Symbols</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>The Blighted Eye</b>: A cracked, blackened eye weeping ash—seen etched on cursed altars, hidden in desperate
            places.</li>
          <li><b>Withered Tree</b>: Once lush, now hollow and lifeless. Often carved where misfortune lingers long.</li>
          <li><b>The Eclipse Halo</b>: A black circle around a pale disc—an eternal reminder of his birth beneath a dying sun.
          </li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Domains</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Misfortune</b>: Wherever luck turns bitter and triumphs collapse, Chernabog walks unseen.</li>
          <li><b>Despair</b>: Not raw destruction, but carefully sown ruin—turning hope to ash and bonds to blades.</li>
          <li><b>Corruption</b>: He is not the chaos of Kaos, but its precision; a seed of rot planted in systems and souls.
          </li>
          <li><b>Creation of Monsters</b>: From his rage, he forged the orcs—brutal reflections of his own exile.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Rites</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>The Mask of Ruin</b>: Said to be worn by Chernabog when walking among mortals. It bears no eyes, only a faint
            smile. It is now a symbol worn by priests of this deity.</li>
          <li><b>Ashblade</b>: A sword carried by his earliest orc warlords, forged from volcanic glass and regret. It breaks
            not bodies, but loyalty. Said to be used to ordain priests in to the ranks of Chernabog.</li>
          <li><b>The Thousand Whispers</b>: A forbidden prayer spoken only by those who have lost everything. The prayer does
            not ask for aid — it asks for vengeance through entropy.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Lore</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>The Founding of the First Orc</b>: Beneath the Dead Peak, Chernabog shaped the first orc from stone, ash,
            and raw will. He did not gift them purpose — he gave them anger. Their hearts burn with echoes of Chernabog’s
            first scream.</li>    
          <li><b>The Ashfall War</b>: When the orcs flooded from his sanctum, no god knew where the tide would end. Cities
            vanished beneath choking smoke. Chernabog himself never lifted a blade — he whispered, and kings tore down their own
            thrones.</li>
          <li><b>The Banishment</b>: The Annarr, unified in fear, shattered Chernabog’s name, divided his orc legions, and
            sealed his sanctum. For a thousand years his name was erased from stone, song, and prayer. But misfortune does not
            sleep.</li>
          <li><b>Worship & Fear</b>: Chernabog is not worshipped openly. His name is muttered only by the broken—prisoners,
            the plague-touched, exiled warlords. Secret cults called The Hollowed Eye plant despair deliberately, believing
            that only ruin brings truth.</li>

        <h2>Herukan</h2>
        <p>
          Born in the shadowed alleys of Varn Hollow under a blood moon, Herukan, a gnome with hauntingly large eyes and
          nimble fingers, was sold to the Carnival of the Shrieking Bell by his parents who could not afford to raise him. Amid cruelty and fractured instruments, he learned to
          channel sorrow through his harp-like voice. One night, after a brutal beating,  his lament awake a Shard of Uzume, an
          ancient fragment of song-power buried in nearby for thousands of years. The shard fused with his soul, and in his next performance, time itself stopped. Herukan, through no choice of his own,
          ascended and became god of song and emotional transformation — one who sings and the world obeys.
        </p>
        <h3>Symbols</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>The Shattered Bell</b>: A cracked handbell, often worn as a pendant. It represents the broken silence Herukan shattered with
            his song at the carnival of the Shrieking Bell. Worshippers never ring it—only wear it. To ring it is to beg for a voice
            in the silence of despair. </li>
          <li><b>“When silence hurts, I listen.”</b>: Whispered creed of Herukan’s faithful.</li>
          <li><b>The Spiral Harp</b> :An impossible harp whose strings spiral into infinity. Appears in murals and frescoes. Used as an emblem by bardic orders aligned with Herukan’s truth-driven music.</li>
          <li><b>The Mask with No Mouth:</b> A simple theatre mask with no mouth, only expressive eye slits. A symbol of those who were never
            heard. Carried by orphans, the exiled, and abused performers. When a follower sings
            with it placed beside them, it’s said Herukan sings in harmony.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Domains</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Song & Emotion</b>: His voice commands tears and ecstasy, weaving potent emotional resonance into all who hear him.</li>
          <li><b>Memory & Loss</b>: He gives form to grief, unlocks nostalgia, and binds memory with melody.</li>
          <li><b>Revelation & Truth</b>: In his harmonies, hidden truths surface; lies unravel to silence.</li>
          <li><b>Veil & Inter-Realm Chorus</b>: Herukan bridges realms, warping reality through sound.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Rites</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>The Blood-Moon Lament</b>: During lunar eclipses, gnome bards perform low dirges in acoustic chambers. As
            tears flow, they believe Herukan listens — rekindling empathy in a world grown harsh.
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <b>Carnival’s Silence</b>: Displaced performers hang broken instruments at doorways. Once silent, they are never played again — tokens of respect for
            the night Herukan’s song turned sorrow into cosmic pause.
          </li>
          
          <li>
            Shard-Adaptive Hymn: melodies are sung in layered counterpoint until the air quivers. When done
            correctly, singers claim to feel doorways open beyond mortal perception.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <img src="assets/mortifer.jpg" alt="" />
        <h2>Mortifer</h2>
        <p>In the merchant city of Velkaria of old Kajistan, where coin ruled more surely than kings, a man named Mortifer was
        born. The youngest of seven sons.</p>

        <p> watched his elder brothers inherit wealth, his sisters bask in admiration, and his father speak only of legacy — not
        his.Jealousy took root early. Power, he believed, was not given but seized. </p>
        
       <p> First, he poisoned his brother's wine. Subtle, slow. Next, he framed the second for a theft he himself
        committed — execution and shame on the family followed. The third he pushed from a tower. With tears convincingly painted on his cheeks he blamed a
        mysterious intruder.  With each corpse, his influence grew. When his father finally looked upon him with realisation and fear instead of 
        indifference, Mortifer smiled.</p>
        
        <p>But wealth did not sate him. Titles did not quench his thirst. His ambitions grew darker than the deepest catacombs. He
        learned forbidden rites from exiled warlocks, whispered prayers in blood, and carved runes into his flesh to court forbidden
        Powers.</p>
        
        <p>One night, beneath a crimson moon, he slew the entire merchant council — thirteen blades, thirteen hearts,
        thirteen names carved into bone. The city fell into chaos, but Mortifer stood unscathed, cloaked in shadow, drenched in
        divinity.</p>
        
        <p>The universe, repulsed yet intrigued, watched as the souls of the slain clung to him. With each act of murder, his essence
        thickened. He was no longer mortal.</p>
        
        <p>He was Murder.</p>
        
        <p>Now, when a blade is drawn with intent, when hatred pulses behind the eyes of men, Mortifer is there — watching, grinning,
        growing.</p>
        
        <p>He became a god not by prayer, but by proof: that death is power, and power, absolute.</p>
