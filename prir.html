          <p>They walk among ruins and riches, memories and myths — gods who were once human. The Prir, known as the Walking Gods,
            are not born divine but become divine. Some ascended through great deeds or deep wisdom. Others stumbled into
            godhood by sheer chance, cruel fate, or cosmic whim. A few were elevated as reward, others as punishment. The
            universe, it seems, has a sense of humor.</p>
          <p>No two Prir are alike. Some are benevolent protectors, lighting the way for their followers. Others are
            unpredictable, vengeful, or wholly indifferent to mortal concerns. Some still whisper to their worshipers, guide
            kings, or stir the wind over battlefields. Others have vanished into silence, lost in their own eternity.</p>
          <p>Yet all share one truth: their power is not infinite. It ebbs and flows with the devotion of those who believe.
            Worship is the lifeblood of a Prir. Shrines, prayers, songs, and sacrifices feed their essence. A forgotten god is a
            fading god. A beloved one burns like a star.</p>
          <p>To understand the Prir is to understand the heights and failings of mortal existence itself — magnified, eternal, and walking
            still.</p>

        <h2>Chernabog</h2>
        <blockquote>"I am not your punishment. I am what comes when you pretend the world is just."</blockquote>
        <p>Among all the Annarr and twisted divines that haunt Skazka’s mythic past, Chernabog is the shadow cast by hope
          itself. Once a forsaken mortal, cursed by fate or Kaos itself, he became god not by ascension—but through
          corruption, hatred, and the mockery of divine pity. Chernabog is misfortune made incarnate: cold, inevitable, and
          patient.</p>
      
        <h3>Symbols</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>The Blighted Eye</b>: A cracked, blackened eye weeping ash—seen etched on cursed altars, hidden in desperate
            places.</li>
          <li><b>Withered Tree</b>: Once lush, now hollow and lifeless. Often carved where misfortune lingers long.</li>
          <li><b>The Eclipse Halo</b>: A black circle around a pale disc—an eternal reminder of his birth beneath a dying sun.
          </li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Domains</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Misfortune</b>: Wherever luck turns bitter and triumphs collapse, Chernabog walks unseen.</li>
          <li><b>Despair</b>: Not raw destruction, but carefully sown ruin—turning hope to ash and bonds to blades.</li>
          <li><b>Corruption</b>: He is not the chaos of Kaos, but its precision; a seed of rot planted in systems and souls.
          </li>
          <li><b>Creation of Monsters</b>: From his rage, he forged the orcs—brutal reflections of his own exile.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Rites</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>The Mask of Ruin</b>: Said to be worn by Chernabog when walking among mortals. It bears no eyes, only a faint
            smile. It is now a symbol worn by priests of this deity.</li>
          <li><b>Ashblade</b>: A sword carried by his earliest orc warlords, forged from volcanic glass and regret. It breaks
            not bodies, but loyalty. Said to be used to ordain priests in to the ranks of Chernabog.</li>
          <li><b>The Thousand Whispers</b>: A forbidden prayer spoken only by those who have lost everything. The prayer does
            not ask for aid — it asks for vengeance through entropy.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Lore</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>The Founding of the First Orc</b>: Beneath the Dead Peak, Chernabog shaped the first orc from stone, ash,
            and raw will. He did not gift them purpose — he gave them anger. Their hearts burn with echoes of Chernabog’s
            first scream.</li>    
          <li><b>The Ashfall War</b>: When the orcs flooded from his sanctum, no god knew where the tide would end. Cities
            vanished beneath choking smoke. Chernabog himself never lifted a blade — he whispered, and kings tore down their own
            thrones.</li>
          <li><b>The Banishment</b>: The Annarr, unified in fear, shattered Chernabog’s name, divided his orc legions, and
            sealed his sanctum. For a thousand years his name was erased from stone, song, and prayer. But misfortune does not
            sleep.</li>
          <li><b>Worship & Fear</b>: Chernabog is not worshipped openly. His name is muttered only by the broken—prisoners,
            the plague-touched, exiled warlords. Secret cults called The Hollowed Eye plant despair deliberately, believing
            that only ruin brings truth.</li>

        <h2>Herukan</h2>
        <p>
          Born in the shadowed alleys of Varn Hollow under a blood moon, Herukan, a gnome with hauntingly large eyes and
          nimble fingers, was sold to the Carnival of the Shrieking Bell by his parents who could not afford to raise him. Amid cruelty and fractured instruments, he learned to
          channel sorrow through his harp-like voice. One night, after a brutal beating,  his lament awake a Shard of Uzume, an
          ancient fragment of song-power buried in nearby for thousands of years. The shard fused with his soul, and in his next performance, time itself stopped. Herukan, through no choice of his own,
          ascended and became god of song and emotional transformation — one who sings and the world obeys.
        </p>
        <h3>Symbols</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>The Shattered Bell</b>: A cracked handbell, often worn as a pendant. It represents the broken silence Herukan shattered with
            his song at the carnival of the Shrieking Bell. Worshippers never ring it—only wear it. To ring it is to beg for a voice
            in the silence of despair. </li>
          <li><b>“When silence hurts, I listen.”</b>: Whispered creed of Herukan’s faithful.</li>
          <li><b>The Spiral Harp</b> :An impossible harp whose strings spiral into infinity. Appears in murals and frescoes. Used as an emblem by bardic orders aligned with Herukan’s truth-driven music.</li>
          <li><b>The Mask with No Mouth:</b> A simple theatre mask with no mouth, only expressive eye slits. A symbol of those who were never
            heard. Carried by orphans, the exiled, and abused performers. When a follower sings
            with it placed beside them, it’s said Herukan sings in harmony.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Domains</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Song & Emotion</b>: His voice commands tears and ecstasy, weaving potent emotional resonance into all who hear him.</li>
          <li><b>Memory & Loss</b>: He gives form to grief, unlocks nostalgia, and binds memory with melody.</li>
          <li><b>Revelation & Truth</b>: In his harmonies, hidden truths surface; lies unravel to silence.</li>
          <li><b>Veil & Inter-Realm Chorus</b>: Herukan bridges realms, warping reality through sound.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Rites</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>The Blood-Moon Lament</b>: During lunar eclipses, gnome bards perform low dirges in acoustic chambers. As
            tears flow, they believe Herukan listens — rekindling empathy in a world grown harsh.
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <b>Carnival’s Silence</b>: Displaced performers hang broken instruments at doorways. Once silent, they are never played again — tokens of respect for
            the night Herukan’s song turned sorrow into cosmic pause.
          </li>
          
          <li>
            Shard-Adaptive Hymn: melodies are sung in layered counterpoint until the air quivers. When done
            correctly, singers claim to feel doorways open beyond mortal perception.
          </li>

        <img src="assets/mortifer.jpg" alt="" />
        <h2>Mortifer</h2>
        <blockquote>“A blade, a name, a silence. This is his prayer.” — from the banned Velkarian Catechism of Knives</blockquote>
        <p>Mortifer was born beneath the counting-houses of Velkaria, ignored even by his own lineage. He watched as brothers
          inherited, sisters were adored, and his father spoke only of legacy — never his. His first kill was not rage, but
          experiment. The next, calculation. Then came artistry. As the bodies fell and his family's line crumbled, Mortifer’s
          name rose like smoke over a ruined ledger. But even wealth and titles could not still his hunger. He turned to the
          forbidden: blood sorcery, exile-born rites, the carving of power into flesh.</p>
        
        <p>On a night soaked in red moonlight, Mortifer killed the city’s entire merchant council — thirteen blades, thirteen
          names, thirteen deaths in one breath. When dawn broke, he stood alone amidst chaos, not merely feared but revered. The
          divine took notice — not to bless him, but to acknowledge him. With each murder done in ambition, his essence deepened.
          With each assassin’s whisper, his shadow lengthened.</p>
        
        <p>He is now worshipped in silence, invoked without voice. No church dares claim him — and yet every assassin, every
          traitor, every power-hungry soul knows his mark. He is the god of murder not as madness, but as method.</p>


<h3>Symbols</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>A nod and a wink</b>: A blood-slick dagger plunged into a coin; this is the calling card of those who serve Mortifer.</li>
  <li><b>A dire warning</b>: a severed hand clutching thirteen black threads; this is the symbol which indicates refuge is close-by for those who follow the Lord of Murder.</li>
  <li><b>Guess whose coming to dinner</b>: a tarot card with a red crescent moon biting through darkness; a gift given to those a devotee intends on killing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Domains</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Planned to perfection</b>: Mortifier is not just about murder, but murder which is planned immactulately.</li>
  <li><b>Slay thy borother</b>: ambition above everything else. Even family should not be above scheming.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rites</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>The Rite of Thirteen</b>: A ritual killing involving thirteen symbolic elements — thirteen blades, thirteen heartbeats, thirteen names whispered. Said to draw Mortifer's gaze directly and confer dark favor or protection in exchange for the killer’s own soul fraying.</li>
  
  <li><b>Velkarian Marking</b>: Practitioners slice the rune of Mortifer — an angular glyph resembling a dagger through an eye — into their skin before committing a murder-for-power. Done properly, the mark never scars, only deepens.</li>
  <img src="assets/mortifer_rune.jpg" alt="">
  
  <li><b>The Crimson Silence</b>: A vow taken by assassins, never to speak of the act once done. Each broken vow supposedly awakens a fragment of Mortifer within, leading to madness or worse — divine possession.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lore</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Mortifer was not born divine</b>: he proved himself divine. In the mercantile sprawl of Velkaria, where merchants bartered souls and family was priced in ledgers, he was a forgotten child: the seventh son, the unmentioned heir. But Mortifer did not beg for legacy. He seized it, body by body, crime by crime, blade by blade. His murders were not acts of madness — they were assertions of order, deliberate, ritualistic, inevitable.</li>
  
  <li><b>He rose by subtraction</b>: thinning the world of his rivals until only he remained. The gods took notice when mortals fled from his shadow rather than from theirs. They watched as he carved divinity into himself — not through worship, but through work.</li>
  
  <li><b>He has no temples, only scenes of crime</b></li>: His sermons are written in bloodstains. His hymns are final breaths.
  
  <li><b>The Ledger of Unspoken Names</b>: A tattered book said to list every name Mortifer has claimed. No ink, only impressions — names felt rather than read.</li>
  
  <li><b>The Dagger of Final Inheritance</b>: A black-bladed relic believed to be the very knife used to slay the merchant council. It thirsts audibly when near betrayal.</li>
  
  <li><b>The Silence-Bound Psalms</b>: Etched onto bone, readable only under blood-moonlight. Reciting one is said to hide a murderer from all gods — save Mortifer.</li>
