      <p>In the wake of the Betrayal at the Celestial Forge, when the Mother-Goddess <a href="uzume.html">Uzume</a> was
        torn asunder, the
        multiverse quaked in mourning. But though her body was broken and her soul cast wide, her firstborn children
        endured. The Annarr, forged from her divine marrow, rose from the ruin of her death like fire from smoldering
        coals — changed, but unbroken. These were beings of immense power and ancient will, shaped not merely to serve
        but to shepherd. To some, they are saviors. To others, tyrants cloaked in celestial fire.</p>
      <p>The Annarr are few, their names whispered in fear and reverence: <a href="frur.html">Frur</a> the Fertile, <a
          href="skald.html">Skald</a>, cold of heart, <a href="aeter.html">Aeter</a>
        the Lightbringer, and <a href="njord.html">Njord</a> the Stormlord. Each carries a fragment of Uzume’s original
        purpose, though time and
        sorrow have changed some from what they once were.</p>
      <p>And yet, even the Annarr are not safe from the rot that crept in after Uzume’s fall. Betrayal breeds betrayal,
        and from within their own ranks stir whispers of war and blasphemy. For not all of them mourn their mother. Not
        all believe the multiverse needs her gift.</p>
      <p>Thus do the Annarr and their companions, the Annarr-kin, walk the twilight edge between light and ruin —
        torchbearers of a dying divinity.</p>
