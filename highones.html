          <p>In the wake of the Betrayal at the Celestial Forge, when the Mother-Goddess Uzume was torn asunder, the multiverse
            quaked in mourning. But though her body was broken and her soul cast wide, her firstborn children endured. The
            Annarr, forged from her divine marrow, rose from the ruin of her death like fire from smoldering coals — changed,
            but unbroken. These were beings of immense power and ancient will, shaped not merely to serve but to shepherd. To
            some, they are saviors. To others, tyrants cloaked in celestial fire.</p>
        
          <p>The Annarr are few, their names whispered in fear and reverence: Frur the Fertile, Skald, cold of heart, Aeter the Lightbringer, and Njord the Stormlord. 
            Each carries a fragment of Uzume’s original purpose, though time and sorrow have changed some from  what they once were. </p>
        
          <p>And yet, even the Annarr are not safe from the rot that crept in after Uzume’s fall. Betrayal breeds betrayal, and
            from within their own ranks stir whispers of war and blasphemy. For not all of them mourn their mother. Not all
            believe the multiverse needs her gift.</p>
        
          <p>Thus do the Annarr and their companions, the Annarr-kin, walk the twilight edge between light and ruin — torchbearers of a dying divinity.</p>
