            <p>In Skazka, the line between hero and villain is a blade in fog. Power wakes under cursed skies, and those
                who earn a name do so in darkness and at a price. Here you’ll meet the figures who shaped its
                blood-stitched history—puppeteers and pawns, saviors and the damned. Choose allies carefully: in Skazka,
                today’s hero may be tomorrow’s nightmare.</p>

            <p>The wild boar, as he is known, became King of Nav'golam upon his father's death 658. He is best known for
                locking the gates to the city at the start of the Shadow War in the year 700 and refusing to allow
                admitance to outsiders for 101 years.</p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Ilistran Darkweaver</h2>
            <p>Ilistran Darkweaver rose to prominence as the enigmatic leader of the Order of the Word, one of Skazka's
                most powerful mage guilds. A master of chaos magic, Darkweaver possessed an insatiable hunger for power
                that extended far beyond the traditional bounds of arcane study. Unlike his peers who viewed magic as a
                tool for knowledge and protection, Ilistran believed that those who wielded such extraordinary abilities
                had not only the right but the duty to rule over the mundane world. His charismatic leadership and
                formidable magical prowess initially drew many followers to his cause, as he promised a new age where
                mages would emerge from the shadows to claim their rightful place as the world's masters.</p>
            <p>However, Darkweaver's radical vision ultimately fractured the very guild he led. When other members of
                the Order of the Word recognized the dangerous extremes of his ambition, they rose in rebellion against
                their former leader, sparking the devastating conflict known as the Shadow War.</p>
            <blockquote>"They say that the abyss is empty. But it is not. I have looked into its eyes and saw myself
                staring back."

            <h2 class="tb-title">High Witch Serona</h2>
            <p>High Witch Serona stands at the pinnacle of Ku’Than’s arcane order—once a warm, steady hand guiding her
                sisters through peril and intrigue, now a figure both revered and feared. Her turning point was the
                murder of her husband, Markus, by the Black Oak cult festering in the Weird Wood. Grief splintered her
                life and cooled her ties to her daughter, Solryn—now a Guardian of the Third Eye. They speak rarely, and
                always at a distance. A stark white streak in Serona’s black hair is said to mark the wound no healing
                can touch.</p>
            <p>Secluded for long stretches, she’s trailed by rumor: that her chambers hold voices not of the living;
                that she bargains with the Weird Wood’s shades; that power and sorrow have driven her near the edge. Yet
                when she steps from solitude, her presence still stills a hall—judgment sharp, authority unquestioned.
            </p>
            <p>Serona now walks a dangerous threshold: leader bound to her people yet pulled deeper into occult
                currents; grieving widow estranged from her heir; a witch whose communion with the dead may steady
                Ku’Than—or tip its fate into shadow.</p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">The Stranger</h2>
            <p>The Stranger is a mysterious individual who has appeared frequently throughout the history of Skazka.</p>
            <p>In addition to eye witness testimony, he has been captured in both paintings and literature. He is viewed
                as an angel of prophecy by some, allegedly having appeared at the site and time of various historical
                events of note. He is seen as benevolent by some but a sign of impending tragedy by others.</p>
            <p>Irrespective of lore and supersticion, he always appears dressed the same: in immauclately clean white
                suits and carrying a notebook and quil. It is said that he appears and disappears in the blink of an
                eye.</p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Maldrath the fire witch</h2>
            <p>Maldrath, a southern sorceress, came north with flame, cunning, and a charisma that bent even hard-bitten
                hunters. Promising food, riches, and glory, she rallied fourscore adventurers for a doomed strike on the
                dragon Icethorn.</p>
            <p>To followers she was possibility incarnate; to rivals, a tangle of ambition and deceit. She led her host
                across the River Horn, where victory soured: Glaclalis—Icethorn’s mate—was slain, and Grimspire fell
                under a curse.</p>
            <p>Her end is uncertain. Some say her spirit still burns in Winter’s halls, fire locked in ice. To many she
                is a warning; to a few, an invitation to test ambition’s crucible.</p>
            <blockquote>
                "She came like summer fire to our frozen lives, all promises of gold and glory… and left nothing but
                ashes. I still dream of her laughter, carried on the wind, and wonder how we ever followed a witch into
                the teeth of a dragon."

            <p>Kul U Dran, chieftain of the Echo Tribe beneath Mount Echo west of Caratania, is to outsiders a cannibal
                warlord; to his own, the Voice of Mekendo, mouthpiece of the fire god said to sleep in the volcano. His
                word is law, indistinguishable from the deity’s.</p>
            <p>Towering, scarred, and daubed in ash and blood, he serves as warrior-priest—casting enemy hearts into the
                crater and reading Mekendo’s will in the roaring magma. His presence alone whips the Echo into
                battle-frenzy.</p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">King Alaric IV</h2>
            <p>King Alaric IV, mid-forties, is a living echo of Caratania’s forebears—so like the kings in the gallery
                that courtiers swear he’s stepped from the portraits. Rarely seen, he’s rumored to move with a hawk’s
                speed, a talent that sits between truth and legend. A fervent devotee of Aeter, he shapes policy by
                prayer more than counsel, his piety deepening through a four-year seclusion that feeds uneasy whispers:
                closer communion… or hidden malady?</p>
            <p>Yet the banners still fly, decrees still bear his seal. Seen or unseen, Alaric remains Caratania’s quiet
                heart—unchanged in visage, swift as a shadow, faithful beyond measure.</p>

            <h2 class="tb-title">Arica Dreamforger</h2>
            <p>Arica Dreamforger—an elven psionic sorceress—led the faction that opposed Ilistran Darkweaver inside the
                Order of the Word, a schism that sparked the Shadow War. Sharp-witted and resolute, she fought not for
                dominion but to preserve balance and redeem a guild buckling under Ilistran’s ambition.</p>
            <p>As Ilistran’s rifts widened, Arica marshaled a desperate defense. In the war’s last days, while sealing a
                major Veil-tear, she was ambushed by Shadow-spawn and slain—brutally, far from any glory—while Ilistran
                himself vanished.</p>
            <p>Her name endures as a rallying cry against unchecked chaos. Even now, some swear her silhouette lingers
                among broken stones at dusk—a dream woven into the memory of the world she tried to save.</p>
