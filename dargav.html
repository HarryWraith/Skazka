            <h2 id="overview" class="tb-title" style="margin-top:10px">Overview</h2>

            <p>Dargav rises from the mist-shrouded valley like a city built for the dead alone, its stone crypts
                climbing the hillside in terraced rows that mirror the homes of the living. Here, where the sacred
                valley is surrounded by the Blightmire, the boundary between life and death grows thin, and the departed
                hold court in halls built to outlast empires.</p>

            <p>For seven centuries, the dead have been the sole citizens of this place, interred in family crypts with
                their weapons, jewellery, and the clothes they wore in life. The stone houses rise in step-like fashion,
                each with a single dark window facing the valley, as if the dead maintain an eternal vigil over the
                world they left behind.</p>

            <p>Pilgrims and mourners arrive at Dargav bearing urns of ash, locks of hair, or personal effects of the
                deceased they wish to honor. The necropolis serves as a waystation between the living world and whatever
                lies beyond, where the bereaved can speak with shadows and receive answers from echoes. Visitors must
                first undergo the Ritual of Descent at the ancient jetty where boats cross the river—removing their
                shoes, washing their hands in blessed water, and speaking aloud the name of the person that has brought
                them here.</p>

            <p>The living are permitted to walk among the crypts only during daylight hours, when the dead rest deepest.
                As shadows lengthen, visitors must retreat to the Guest House of Sorrows, a modest inn built at the
                necropolis's edge where meals are served in silence and no mirrors hang upon the walls. Those who
                violate the sunset curfew report experiencing the Fear of the Dead—a bone-deep terror that drives them
                mad or catatonic, though some claim to have learned profound truths about mortality from their ordeal.

                preparation chambers dedicated to different gods and their burial customs. The temple's priests possess
                ancient knowledge of every death-ritual known to mortals, ensuring each soul departs according to their

                in cloth that grants immunity to fire, tend each pyre with ritualistic precision, chanting the soul's
                name until the last bone turns to ash. The smoke rises through carved chimney-towers that spiral toward
                the heavens, carrying prayers and final messages to the gods above.</p>

                who has passed through Dargav. The plaques themselves are works of art, glowing faintly when touched by
                those who shared blood or love with the deceased. The Hall of Records contains not just names and dates,
                but detailed accounts of each person's life, fears, loves, and final words, creating the most
                comprehensive library of mortality ever assembled.</p>

            <p>Reserved for nobility and wealthy merchants, this terraced garden cemetery overlooks the valley with
                elaborate mausoleums that rival palaces in their grandeur. Each tomb is a masterwork of architecture.
                The groundskeepers are master artisans who maintain elaborate topiary gardens shaped like the heraldic
                beasts of each buried family, and the pathways are paved with stones that record the footsteps of
                visitors, allowing the dead to know who remembers them.</p>

            <p>Deep beneath Dargav lies an ancient cave system where those without coin for proper burial are laid to
                rest in natural chambers carved by underground rivers. The caves stretch for miles through the
                mountain's heart; their walls lined with alcoves holding countless remains. Here, the poor achieve a
                democracy in death impossible in life—their bones eventually mixing together in great calcium pools
                where individual identity dissolves into collective memory. The cave-spirits that dwell here are ancient
                beyond measure, and some claim they can answer questions about the very first humans to die in this
                valley.</p>

            <p>Built from obsidian quarried from the Underworld, this chapel serves as the ceremonial heart of Dargav
                where the most sacred death-rites are performed. Its interior is lit only by phosphorescent fungi that
                grow in patterns resembling constellations, and its altar is carved from a single massive geode filled
                with crystals that resonate with the voices of the dead. Here, the Keeper of Souls performs the Rite of
                Final Passage for those souls who cannot rest, and the Chapel's acoustics are designed so that every
                whisper echoes thirteen times—once for each traditional stage of death's journey.</p>

            <p>This sprawling inn provides lodging for mourners, pilgrims, and scholars who come to study death's
                mysteries. The innkeeper, always chosen from among those who have briefly died and returned to life,
                maintains strict rules about noise and conduct—for the inn serves both living guests and spectral
                visitors who require their own accommodations in the ethereal rooms that exist between the physical

            <p>Even in the city of the dead, the living have needs, and this establishment serves those whose grief
                manifests as hunger for human connection. The courtesans here practice the ancient art of consolation,
                skilled not just in physical pleasure but in the emotional healing of those bereaved. The house is run
                by the Priestess of the Wolf, who ensures her charges are trained in psychology and theology as well as
                more carnal arts. Many visitors find that the house offers them the first peaceful sleep they've known
                since their loss, for here grief is understood as a natural part of life rather than a burden to be
                hidden.</p>

            <p>The most mysterious institution in Dargav, this hospital treats those who have died and returned—whether
                through resurrection magic, divine intervention, or sheer stubborn will. The Reborn often suffer from
                unique maladies: memories that belong to other deceased persons, partial transparency, ability to see
                and hear spirits constantly, or gradual fading back toward death. The hospital's physicians specialize
                in anchoring souls to bodies that have already begun their journey toward the afterlife, using
                treatments that blend medicine, magic, and theology in equal measure.</p>
