            <h3 class="skz-viking">Population</h3>
            <p>Winter’s people are survivors and descendants of exiles from Grimspire. Though few can claim pure
                lineage, many noble families trace their bloodline—especially those of the Dark Walkers, the only
                fighters who spurned the ill-fated hunt. The populace is rugged and shapeshifting with the seasons:
                monster hunters, trappers, miners, dragonborn and goliaths intermingle. Their numbers swell in summer’s
                light, thinning when lethal winter blankets the wilds.</p>
            <h3 class="skz-viking">Politics</h3>
            <p>Governance rests in the Winter Alliance, a fragile truce among three powerful houses: Von Nightshade,
                Icebreaker, and Dragoon. Each holds sway over specific sectors—hunting guilds, mining rights, and
                defense, respectively. The Alliance maintains a tense stability, upheld less by law and more by mutual
                wariness and shared memory of Grimspire’s fall. All notable decisions—alliances, dispensation of
                prospecting rights, even warnings to outlawed expeditions to the citadel—are brokered through this
                uneasy council.</p>

            <p>Welcome to Winter, a forlorn bastion on the edge of desolation—the last hearth before the vast, merciless
                snows. In the land of Kelos, Winter serves as an independent city-state where the hardy carve out a
                fragile existence beneath the long shadow of the frozen citadel, Grimspire. A place where myth and
                memory intertwine, and the price of magic and vengeance lingers in the very ice that holds the world
                together—a tale told best in whispers.</p>

            <h2 class="skz-viking">The Hall of the Winter Alliance</h2>
            <p>A timber-and-stone longhall that serves as the council chamber for the three ruling houses: Von
                Nightshade, Icebreaker, and Dragoon. Inside, ancestral banners hang heavy with frost, and the central
                firepit never burns more than embers—symbolic of fragile unity. Disputes are settled here, often with
                daggers of words, sometimes with steel.</p>
            <h2 class="skz-viking">The Hunter’s Lodge</h2>
            <p>A sprawling inn, guildhouse, and marketplace all in one. Monster hunters from across Kelos congregate
                here to take contracts, boast of trophies, or drink themselves senseless. Its walls are lined with grim
                trophies—fangs, claws, and broken weapons taken from beasts slain in the north. Outsiders find both
                opportunity and danger within these smoke-choked halls.</p>
            <h2 class="skz-viking">Nightshade Chapel</h2>
            <p>Built and maintained by House Von Nightshade, this shrine is dedicated less to gods than to remembrance.
                Within lie the memorial stones of Grimspire’s fallen, though their names are spoken with shame. The
                chapel’s black-veined stone and ever-burning candles are said to draw the dreams of the dead, making it
                a place both sacred and unsettling.</p>

            <h2 class="skz-viking">Visiting Winter</h2>
            <p>To those brave enough (or desperate enough) to come:</p>

            <p>The road east leads directly into Caratania and ends at the fortified town of Harnburg and it is here
                that Winter conducts most of its trade.</p>

            <p>The town of Winter offers basic—but vital—amenities: inns of timber and hearth, a mercantile hub for
                traders, and a bustling monster-hunting guild that never sleeps. But it does not have the noise or chaos
                of cities or more southerly towns.</p>

            <p>Hunting guides and trappers still venture north in summer; in return, the town exchanges pelts, ore, and
                precious tales of Grimspire’s fate, but work opportunities are limited. Every year there is talk of
                reopening the gold mine which sits close to Grimspire, but every year th Aliance rejects the request.
            </p>

            <p>The town’s goliaths and dragonborn, stoic and ash-pale, stand as silent guardians, guided by traditions
                both ancestral and arcane. The town has a silent, stoic undertone, but where talk is viewed as cheap and
                conversation only takes place when necessary. </p>

            <p>Visitors should heed the unspoken rule: do not disturb Grimspire. Tales of the white dragon, the
                death-blasted citadel, and the undead hunters walk among the icy corridors are whispered to discourage
                adventurers. The noble houses—keepers of that shameful legacy—keep these stories alive, weaving them
                into the bitter winter wind.</p>

            <h2 class="skz-viking">The Legend of Citadel Grimspire</h2>

            <h3 class="skz-viking">Inception</h3>
            <p>When the celestial calamity known as Starfall ravaged the north, even the vicious Northmen were forced
                south—bringing them into conflict with the dragon Icethorn. To avert carnage, the Deadland Accord was
                brokered: Northmen hunters were granted land east of the River Horn, provided they did not trespass into
                Icethorn’s domain—and aided in erecting a fortress as tribute.</p>

            <h3 class="skz-viking">Construction</h3>
            <p>Beginning in Year 12, the citadel rose from the mountain’s flank in fifteen years, carved from granite by
                Frost Giant craftsmen—one last friendship amid growing mistrust. Icethorn herself granted the magic that
                shields it from cold, forging a granite stronghold sculpted into an upper and lower citadel, surrounded
                by a sprawling log-cabin town.</p>

            <h3 class="skz-viking">Downfall</h3>
            <p>Pride rotted the citadel’s heart. The charismatic Fire Witch Maldrath arrived from the south, lured
                hunters with promises of power and plunder against Icethorn. Only the elite Dark Walkers, hunters of
                code and conscience, refused. Maldrath led eighty hunters west over the Horn. They slew a white dragon
                and her eggs—only to discover they had murdered Glaclalis, Icethorn’s mate, not the dragon herself. In
                drunken revelry, they returned rich—but death was on its way.</p>

            <p>That night, Icethorn unleashed her wrath: Grimspire was frozen, reviled, and forever cursed.</p>

        <article class="right-column, article-small"> <!-- RIGHT -->
            <h2 class="skz-viking">Icebreaker Yards</h2>
            <p>The open fields and training grounds of House Icebreaker, where goliaths and dragonborn drill with axe
                and spear. The clanging of steel carries across town, and it is here that Winter’s famed hunting parties
                are armed and outfitted before venturing into the wilderness. During festivals, the yards host brutal
                contests of strength and endurance.</p>
            <h2 class="skz-viking">The Frost Market</h2>
            <p>Winter’s mercantile heart, set within a ring of log-built stalls that remain open even in bitter snow.
                Trappers sell furs beside prospectors hawking ore and gems, while spice traders from Caratania bring
                rare warmth to the icy air. Rumors speak of black-market stalls hidden in back alleys, where relics from
                Grimspire and dragonbone charms change hands under hooded cloaks.</p>
            <h2 class="skz-viking">The Dragoon Warrens</h2>
            <p>A fortified cluster of stone dwellings belonging to House Dragoon, carved partly into the hillside
                beneath Winter. Known for their secrecy and discipline, the Dragoons maintain the warrens as both
                barracks and home. Whispers claim that tunnels beneath connect to the ancient foundations of Grimspire
                itself, though few outside the house have ever walked them and returned.</p>
