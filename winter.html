            <h2 id="overview" class="tb-title" style="margin-top:10px">Overview</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Winter, a forlorn bastion on the edge of desolation—the last hearth before the vast, merciless
                snows. In the land of Kelos, Winter serves as an independent city-state where the hardy carve out a
                fragile existence beneath the long shadow of the frozen citadel, Grimspire. A place where myth and
                memory intertwine, and the price of magic and vengeance lingers in the very ice that holds the world
                together—a tale told best in whispers.</p>
            <p>To those brave enough (or desperate enough) to come:</p>

            <p>The road east leads directly into Caratania and ends at the fortified town of Harnburg and it is here
                that Winter conducts most of its trade.</p>

            <p>The town of Winter offers basic—but vital—amenities: inns of timber and hearth, a mercantile hub for
                traders, and a bustling monster-hunting guild that never sleeps. But it does not have the noise or chaos
                of cities or more southerly towns.</p>

            <p>Hunting guides and trappers still venture north in summer; in return, the town exchanges pelts, ore, and
                precious tales of Grimspire’s fate, but work opportunities are limited. Every year there is talk of
                reopening the gold mine which sits close to Grimspire, but every year th Aliance rejects the request.
            </p>

            <p>The town’s goliaths and dragonborn, stoic and ash-pale, stand as silent guardians, guided by traditions
                both ancestral and arcane. The town has a silent, stoic undertone, but where talk is viewed as cheap and
                conversation only takes place when necessary.</p>

            <p>Visitors should heed the unspoken rule: do not disturb Grimspire. Tales of the white dragon, the
                death-blasted citadel, and the undead hunters walk among the icy corridors are whispered to discourage
                adventurers. The noble houses—keepers of that shameful legacy—keep these stories alive, weaving them
                into the bitter winter wind.</p>

            <p>A timber-and-stone longhall that serves as the council chamber for the three ruling houses: Von
                Nightshade, Icebreaker, and Dragoon. Inside, ancestral banners hang heavy with frost, and the central
                firepit never burns more than embers—symbolic of fragile unity. Disputes are settled here, often with
                daggers of words, sometimes with steel.</p>

                here to take contracts, boast of trophies, or drink themselves senseless. Its walls are lined with grim
                trophies—fangs, claws, and broken weapons taken from beasts slain in the north. Outsiders find both
                opportunity and danger within these smoke-choked halls.</p>

                Within lie the memorial stones of Grimspire’s fallen, though their names are spoken with shame. The
                chapel’s black-veined stone and ever-burning candles are said to draw the dreams of the dead, making it

                are armed and outfitted before venturing into the wilderness. During festivals, the yards host brutal

                Trappers sell furs beside prospectors hawking ore and gems, while spice traders from Caratania bring
                rare warmth to the icy air. Rumors speak of black-market stalls hidden in back alleys, where relics from
                Grimspire and dragonbone charms change hands under hooded cloaks.</p>

                barracks and home. Whispers claim that tunnels beneath connect to the ancient foundations of Grimspire

                and secrets, but few return.
