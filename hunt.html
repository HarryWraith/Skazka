      <!-- ===== Overview ===== -->
      <h2 id="overview" class="tb-title">Overview</h2>
      <p>The Wild Hunt represents one of the most terrifying and mysterious phenomena in the spiritual realm - a
        collective consciousness formed from the vengeful souls of hunters who died with such fierce determination that
        they refused to accept death's finality. Neither truly alive nor properly dead, these spectral huntsmen exist in
        a liminal state between worlds, their individual identities merged into a singular, terrifying purpose that
        transcends mortal understanding. Every midwinter, when the veil between worlds grows thin and the nights reach
        their longest, this ghostly procession manifests across the countryside in a thunderous cavalcade of spectral
        hounds, phantom steeds, and ethereal huntsmen armed with otherworldly weapons. Their criteria for selecting
        victims remains one of the great unsolved mysteries of the supernatural world - some years they claim kings and
        heroes, other years they take simple farmers or wandering children, with no discernible pattern that mortal
        minds can comprehend. What drives them is equally enigmatic: some scholars believe they hunt to fill their ranks
        with worthy souls, others theorize they seek to balance some cosmic injustice, while the most disturbing
        theories suggest they simply hunt because hunting is all they remember how to do. Unlike traditional gods who
        can be bargained with, reasoned with, or appeased through worship, The Wild Hunt operates according to alien
        logic that makes them perhaps the most unpredictable and feared supernatural force in existence.

    <!-- ===== Influence
 ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="domains">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Influence</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Death</strong>: Keep the threshold—sense looming deaths, commune with the newly dead, and nudge
          fate’s timing; command restless spirits.</li>
        <li><strong>Hunt</strong>: Track any quarry—heightened survival and pursuit, spectral hounds at call, slip
          through obstacles mid-chase.</li>
        <li><strong>Winter</strong>: Rule the long night—ice and snow at your word, clear sight in darkness, silent
          passage; blizzards and freezing strikes.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Symbols  ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="symbols">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Symbols</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Spectral Antler Crown</strong>: Translucent antlers that shift in cold mist—mark of primal hunt and
          authority over life/death; carved into way-trees and sometimes manifesting where the Hunt will ride.</li>
        <li><strong>Howling Horn</strong>: Bone-ivory horn whose notes stream as fleeing spirits—the call none can
          ignore; hearing it in dreams foretells their coming.</li>
        <li><strong>Endless Track</strong>: Hoof, paw, and boot prints spiraling without end—once marked, the quarry
          never escapes; paths circle back to the beginning.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Tenets ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="tenets">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Tenets</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Answer the Horn: When the call comes, ride—leave hearth and kin. The Hunt outranks all other oaths.</li>
        <li>Spare the Unmarked: Take only the named quarry. Cross any boundary to pursue, but do not spill innocent
          blood.</li>
        <li>Close the Circle: Run the chase to its end; offer trophies to moon and root, keep winter’s silence, and name
          the dead you fell.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Rites & Offerings ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="rites">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Rites</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Midwinter Vigil</strong>: On the longest night, sentinels hold liminal posts with blessed arms,
          fear-wood fires, and warning bells. Stay awake till dawn to earn a year’s protection—though some say it draws
          the Hunt instead.</li>
        <li><strong>Offering of the Worthy Hunt</strong>: A willing master-hunter tracks a spectral quarry for seven
          nights. Success grants a year of supernatural prowess—and a permanent mark; failure means vanishing into the
          Hunt.</li>
        <li><strong>Rite of False Death</strong>: Stage your own death and remain “dead” three nights amid visions of
          the Hunt. If you rise unchanged, you win brief reprieve; many rise not at all.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="tb-title">Lore</h2>
      <p>
        Legend holds the Wild Hunt began as mortal legends chasing a mythic quarry—divine stag, dragon, or Death
        itself—across realms until they crossed the life-death boundary and never turned back. In some tellings a dying
        god cursed their hubris; in others they chose the chase over rest. Their original prey still leads their
        midwinter rides, always a breath beyond reach.
