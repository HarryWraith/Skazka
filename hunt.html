      <ul class="nodec">
        <li><b>The Spectral Antler crown</b>: A crown of translucent, ghostly antlers that seem to shift and move when
          viewed directly, often depicted wreathed in cold mist or ethereal flames. The antlers represent the primal
          nature of the hunt and the crown signifies their collective authority over life and death. This symbol appears
          carved into trees along their hunting paths and is said to manifest spontaneously in areas where they will
          soon ride.</li>
        <li><b>The Howling Horn</b>: A curved hunting horn that appears to be carved from bone or ivory, with musical
          notes streaming from it that take the form of fleeing spirits. The horn represents the call that no living
          soul can ignore when The Wild Hunt rides, and the musical notes symbolize the souls they have claimed. The
          sound of this horn in dreams is considered an omen of impending visitation.</li>
        <li><b>The Endless Track</b>: A series of hoofprints, paw prints, and boot prints that form an infinite spiral,
          with some prints appearing fresh while others fade into mist. This symbol represents the eternal nature of
          their hunt and the fact that once marked by them, one can never truly escape. The spiral suggests that their
          hunting paths eventually lead back to the beginning, trapping their quarry in an inescapable cycle.</li>

      <p>The Wild Hunt represents one of the most terrifying and mysterious phenomena in the spiritual realm - a
        collective consciousness formed from the vengeful souls of hunters who died with such fierce determination
        that
        they refused to accept death's finality. Neither truly alive nor properly dead, these spectral huntsmen exist
        in
        a liminal state between worlds, their individual identities merged into a singular, terrifying purpose that
        transcends mortal understanding. Every midwinter, when the veil between worlds grows thin and the nights reach
        their longest, this ghostly procession manifests across the countryside in a thunderous cavalcade of spectral
        hounds, phantom steeds, and ethereal huntsmen armed with otherworldly weapons. Their criteria for selecting
        victims remains one of the great unsolved mysteries of the supernatural world - some years they claim kings
        and
        heroes, other years they take simple farmers or wandering children, with no discernible pattern that mortal
        minds can comprehend. What drives them is equally enigmatic: some scholars believe they hunt to fill their
        ranks
        with worthy souls, others theorize they seek to balance some cosmic injustice, while the most disturbing
        theories suggest they simply hunt because hunting is all they remember how to do. Unlike traditional gods who
        can be bargained with, reasoned with, or appeased through worship, The Wild Hunt operates according to alien
        logic that makes them perhaps the most unpredictable and feared supernatural force in existence.</p>

      <h2 class="tb-title">Rites</h2>
      <ul class="nodec">
        <li><b>Midwinter Vigil</b>: Performed on the longest night of the year, this dangerous rite involves a
          community
          posting sentinels at crossroads, forest edges, and other liminal spaces where The Wild Hunt is likely to
          manifest. The vigil-keepers must remain awake and alert throughout the entire night, armed with blessed
          weapons and protective talismans. They burn special fires made from woods that spirits fear and ring bells
          to
          warn others of the Hunt's approach. Those who successfully complete the vigil without falling asleep or
          abandoning their posts are said to gain protection from supernatural pursuit for the following year, though
          some claim the rite actually draws The Wild Hunt's attention rather than repelling it.</li>
        <li><b>The offering of the worthy hunt</b>: A controversial ritual where communities deliberately sacrifice
          their finest hunter to The Wild Hunt, believing this will satisfy their appetite and spare others. The
          chosen
          hunter must willingly participate, spending seven days and nights in the wilderness tracking a supernatural
          quarry - often a white stag or spectral wolf that appears only to those marked for the ritual. If the hunter
          successfully completes this impossible hunt, they are granted a year of supernatural hunting prowess but are
          forever marked by The Wild Hunt. If they fail, they vanish entirely, presumably claimed by the spirits to
          join
          their eternal procession.</li>
        <li><b>The Rite of false death</b>: Desperate individuals who believe they are marked by The Wild Hunt
          sometimes
          attempt this ritual, which involves staging an elaborate fake death complete with burial or funeral pyre.
          The
          participant must remain "dead" for three days and nights, during which they experience visions of the Hunt
          and
          sometimes communicate with its members. If they emerge from this false death unchanged, they may have
          successfully confused the spirits and gained temporary reprieve. However, many who attempt this rite are
          found
          truly dead, suggesting The Wild Hunt is not easily deceived.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="tb-panel">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Domains</h2>
      <ul class="nodec">
        <li><b>Death</b>: The Wild Hunt governs the boundary between life and death, particularly violent or untimely
          deaths related to hunting, pursuit, or being hunted. Clerics who serve them can speak with the spirits of
          the
          recently deceased, sense impending death, and sometimes delay or hasten the moment of passing. They also
          possess abilities related to necromancy and communion with restless spirits.</li>
        <li><b>The Hunt</b>: This domain encompasses all aspects of tracking, pursuit, and the primal relationship
          between predator and prey. Followers gain enhanced abilities in survival, tracking, and combat, as well as
          supernatural senses that allow them to hunt both physical and spiritual quarry. They can also summon
          spectral
          hounds and gain the ability to phase through obstacles during pursuit.</li>
        <li><b>Winter</b>: The Wild Hunt is intrinsically tied to the darkest, coldest months when death comes easily
          and the natural world sleeps. This domain grants power over ice, snow, and bitter cold, as well as the
          ability
          to see clearly in darkness and move silently through winter landscapes. Clerics can create supernatural
          blizzards, freeze opponents, and draw strength from cold environments.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="tb-panel">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Lore</h2>
      <ul class="nodec">
        <li>Ancient legends speak of the original Wild Hunt as a group of legendary hunters who pursued a mythical
          creature - variously described as a divine stag, a dragon, or Death itself - across multiple realms and
          dimensions. Their quarry led them on such an epic chase that they passed through the boundaries of life
          and
          death without realizing it, becoming trapped in an eternal pursuit that stripped away their humanity piece
          by
          piece. Some versions claim they were cursed by a dying god for their hubris, while others suggest they
          willingly chose eternal hunting over eternal rest. The creature they originally pursued is said to still
          lead
          them on their midwinter rides, forever staying just beyond their reach.</li>
        <li>Scholars who study The Wild Hunt have attempted to discern patterns in their selections, leading to
          numerous
          theories but no definitive answers. Some believe they take those who have cheated death, others think they
          claim individuals who possess rare spiritual qualities, and still others theorize they abduct people to
          serve
          specific roles in their otherworldly realm. One disturbing theory suggests that each member of The Wild
          Hunt
          was once an abductee who gradually transformed into a hunter themselves, meaning every person they take
          eventually becomes part of their number. The most unsettling accounts come from those few individuals who
          claim to have escaped The Wild Hunt, reporting that the spectral hunters seemed to be testing them rather
          than
          simply pursuing them.</li>
        <li>Some supernatural scholars believe The Wild Hunt serves as enforcers or agents for a greater power -
          possibly the Winter Court of the fae or some primordial entity that rules over death and winter. According
          to
          this theory, their seemingly random abductions are actually targeted operations designed to maintain some
          cosmic balance or fulfill ancient pacts made between the mortal world and supernatural powers. Evidence
          for
          this includes reports of The Wild Hunt avoiding certain locations protected by specific wards, their
          apparent
          coordination with other winter spirits, and the fact that their activities sometimes seem to prevent
          greater
          calamities from befalling regions they visit. If true, this would mean The Wild Hunt, despite their
          terrifying
          nature, might actually serve as a necessary force that protects the world from even worse supernatural
          threats.</li>
