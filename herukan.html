             <h3>Symbols</h3>
      <ul class="nodec">
        <li><b>The Shattered Bell</b>: A cracked handbell, often worn as a pendant. It represents the broken silence
          Herukan shattered with
          his song at the carnival of the Shrieking Bell. Worshippers never ring it—only wear it. To ring it is to beg
          for a voice
          in the silence of despair. </li>
        <li><b>“When silence hurts, I listen.”</b>: Whispered creed of Herukan’s faithful.</li>
        <li><b>The Spiral Harp</b> :An impossible harp whose strings spiral into infinity. Appears in murals and
          frescoes. Used as an emblem by bardic orders aligned with Herukan’s truth-driven music.</li>
        <li><b>The Mask with No Mouth:</b> A simple theatre mask with no mouth, only expressive eye slits. A symbol of
          those who were never
          heard. Carried by orphans, the exiled, and abused performers. When a follower sings
          with it placed beside them, it’s said Herukan sings in harmony.</li>

      <p>
        Born in the shadowed alleys of Varn Hollow under a blood moon, Herukan, a gnome with hauntingly large eyes and
        nimble fingers, was sold to the Carnival of the Shrieking Bell by his parents who could not afford to raise him.
        Amid cruelty and fractured instruments, he learned to
        channel sorrow through his harp-like voice. One night, after a brutal beating, his lament awake a Shard of
        Uzume, an
        ancient fragment of song-power buried in nearby for thousands of years. The shard fused with his soul, and in
        his next performance, time itself stopped. Herukan, through no choice of his own,
        ascended and became god of song and emotional transformation — one who sings and the world obeys.

        <li>
          <b>The Blood-Moon Lament</b>: During lunar eclipses, gnome bards perform low dirges in acoustic chambers. As
          tears flow, they believe Herukan listens — rekindling empathy in a world grown harsh.
        </li>
      
        <li>
          <b>Carnival’s Silence</b>: Displaced performers hang broken instruments at doorways. Once silent, they are
          never played again — tokens of respect for
          the night Herukan’s song turned sorrow into cosmic pause.
        </li>
      
        <li>
          Shard-Adaptive Hymn: melodies are sung in layered counterpoint until the air quivers. When done
          correctly, singers claim to feel doorways open beyond mortal perception.

      <h3>Lore</h3>
      <ul class="nodec">
        <li>Long after his ascension, Herukan returned in secret to Varn Hollow,
          wearing the Mask with No Mouth. The city had outlawed music—its ruler fearing that melody might stir rebellion. On
          the night of a rare double eclipse, Herukan stood beneath the gallows where the last street-bard had been executed
          and plucked a single note on an unseen instrument. The sound did not reach ears—it reached memories.
          Every soul in the city remembered their first song, their first dance, their first whispered lullaby. The silence
          laws shattered not through protest, but through an uncontrollable chorus as every citizen began to hum at once. It
          is said the ruler tore out his own tongue that night, unable to bear the truth Herukan’s note had forced him to
          face. </li>
        <li>
        In the Age of Glass Thrones, a great plague spread—not of body, but of mind.
        Victims lost their memories, living as hollow shells. Desperate healers turned to Herukan’s followers, who recalled an
        ancient rite known as the Seven Harmonies of Forgetting. Paradoxically, the cure came not from restoring memory, but
        by letting go of pain so deep it shackled the mind.
        For seven nights, masked choirs sang each harmony, one per night, while walking through the streets with Shattered
        Bells around their necks. Each harmony dissolved a layer of sorrow until, on the seventh night, the afflicted awoke
        with tears on their faces, able to recall their names once more. They had not recovered all their memories—only the
        ones worth keeping.      
        </li>
        <li>
          Bardic tradition speaks of a single performance in the Court of Dawn when
          Herukan, challenged by a rival god of silence, strung the Spiral Harp with threads of light pulled from the morning
          sun. Each note captured a fragment of the sky, and with every chord, stars appeared where there should have been
          daylight. The god of silence, unprepared for beauty that did not require words, withdrew from the mortal realm for a hundred
          years. Followers of Herukan still believe that on certain mornings, if you look closely at the sunrise, you can see
          faint spiral strings reaching upward, resonating with the echo of that impossible performance.
