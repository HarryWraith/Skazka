      <!-- ===== Overview ===== -->
      <h2 id="overview" class="tb-title">Overview</h2>
      <p>Born in the shadowed alleys of Varn Hollow under a blood moon, Herukan, a gnome with hauntingly large eyes and
        nimble fingers, was sold to the Carnival of the Shrieking Bell by his parents who could not afford to raise him.
        Amid cruelty and fractured instruments, he learned to channel sorrow through his harp-like voice. One night,
        after a brutal beating, his lament awake a Shard of Uzume, an ancient fragment of song-power buried in nearby
        for thousands of years. The shard fused with his soul, and in his next performance, time itself stopped.
        Herukan, through no choice of his own, ascended and became god of song and emotional transformation — one who
        sings and the world obeys.</p>

 ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="domains">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Influence</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Song & Emotion</strong>: His voice commands tears and ecstasy, weaving potent emotional resonance
          into all who hear him.</li>
        <li><strong>Memory & Loss</strong>: He gives form to grief, unlocks nostalgia, and binds memory with melody.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Revelation & Truth</strong>: In his harmonies, hidden truths surface; lies unravel to silence.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- ===== Symbols  ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="symbols">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Symbols</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Shattered Bell</strong>: A cracked handbell, often worn as a pendant. It represents the broken
          silence Herukan shattered with his song at the carnival of the Shrieking Bell. Worshippers never ring it—only
          wear it. To ring it is to beg for a voice in the silence of despair.</li>
        <li><strong>The Spiral Harp</strong>: An impossible harp whose strings spiral into infinity. Appears in murals
          and frescoes. Used as an emblem by bardic orders aligned with Herukan’s truth-driven music.</li>
        <li><strong>The Mask with No Mouth</strong>: A simple theatre mask with no mouth, only expressive eye slits. A
          symbol of those who were never heard. Carried by orphans, the exiled, and abused performers. When a follower
          sings with it placed beside them, it’s said Herukan sings in harmony.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Tenets ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="tenets">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Tenets</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Sing truth that unmasks and mends—give voice to the unheard, and let lies fall to silence.</li>
        <li>Transmute sorrow—carry grief through song until it becomes grace, keeping only the memories worth keeping.
        </li>
        <li>Honor sacred silence; strike notes with purpose, never vanity—let your chorus bridge worlds, not wound them.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Rites & Offerings ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="rites">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Rites</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Blood-Moon Lament</strong>: During lunar eclipses, gnome bards perform low dirges in acoustic
          chambers. As tears flow, they believe Herukan listens — rekindling empathy in a world grown harsh.</li>
        <li><strong>Carnival’s Silence</strong>: Displaced performers hang broken instruments at doorways. Once silent,
          they are never played again — tokens of respect for the night Herukan’s song turned sorrow into cosmic pause.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Shard-Adaptive Hymn</strong>: melodies are sung in layered counterpoint until the air quivers. When
          done correctly, singers claim to feel doorways open beyond mortal perception.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- ===== Lore ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="lore">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Lore</h2>
      <p>In the Age of Glass Thrones, a great plague spread—not of body, but of mind. Victims lost their memories,
        living as hollow shells. Desperate healers turned to Herukan’s followers, who recalled an ancient rite known as
        the Seven Harmonies of Forgetting. Paradoxically, the cure came not from restoring memory, but by letting go of
        pain so deep it shackled the mind. For seven nights, masked choirs sang each harmony, one per night, while
        walking through the streets with Shattered Bells around their necks. Each harmony dissolved a layer of sorrow
        until, on the seventh night, the afflicted awoke with tears on their faces, able to recall their names once
        more. They had not recovered all their memories—only the ones worth keeping.</p>
