        <h2>Aeter</h2>
        <p>In the mythic pantheon of Skazka, Aeter, the radiant God of Light, reigns as a beacon against encroaching
          darkness — both literal and spiritual. His brilliance brings clarity, hope, and renewal, yet he is neither naive nor
          blind to temptation: true light requires responsibility. As the keeper of the celestial forge, Aeter is revered by
          scholars, healers, and those who seek to banish shadow from the soul.</p>
      
        <h3>Symbols</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Crown of Dazzling Rays</b>: Forged from pure light, it glimmers like the sun at zenith — an emblem of his boundless
            presence and wisdom.</li>
      
          <li><b>Everlight Orb</b>: A small globe of concentrated sunlight that never dims — its warmth is healing, its glow reveals
            truth, and it can shatter unholy darkness.</li>
      
          <li><b>Radiant Scepter</b>: Topped with a living flame that burns with the warmth of dawn, this staff channels his
            influence whenever light is needed.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Domains</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Illumination & Truth</b>: Aeter is the arbiter of clarity, exposing lies and unveiling hidden things. Scholars
            invoke him in pursuit of knowledge; judges in service of justice.</li>
      
          <li><b>Hope & Renewal</b>: Especially during total darkness — night, winter, loss of faith — his presence reminds the
            pantheon’s followers that morning always returns.</li>
      
          <li><b>Civilization & Artistic Flame</b>: Poets, architects, musicians, and artisans seek inspiration from his glow.
            Creativity flourishes under his favor, pushing civilization ever forward.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Rites</h3>
      
        <ul>
          <li><b>Dawn’s Renewal</b>: At the break of dawn, Sun Elf communities gather in temple courtyards to kindle communal
            Everlight lamps. Each person brings a reflective plate that captures the morning sun before passing it to their
            neighbor — a symbol that light, once shared, grows brighter.</li>
      
          <li><b>The Everlight Trials</b>: Young Sun Elves undergo a trial under Aeter’s observance. They must craft or shape
            something that reflects light  —be it glasswork, art, song, or architecture. Success demonstrates mastery of both
            craft and purpose; failure reminds them that light untended fades.</li>
      
          <li><b>Feast of the Turning</b>: On the summer solstice, temples open every window and let shouts of “Aeter, guide our
            path!” ring out at sunrise. Pilgrims carry candles that burn black smoke which turns godlen in the dawn light.</li>
        </ul>

         <h3>Lore: The Sunlight Gift & the Birth of the Sun Elves</h3>
        <p>Long ago, when dark elven exiles — driven from the Underdark by their own misdeeds — fled upward to the realm
          of mortals, they were twisted by shadow and despair. Aeter pitying them, reached down and cast a fragment of pure
          sunlight into their midst: the Everlight.</p>
        <p>The infusion of Aeter’s gift altered their essence. Their once-dark skins glowed with a gentle
          luminescence, their eyes reflecting dawn’s first light. These exiles became the first Sun Elves, noble and fair,
          dedicated to justice and to spreading light wherever darkness threatens.</p>
      
        <p>Over generations, Sun Elves built grand solar temples, inscribed with stories of Everlight and Aeter’s benevolence.
          Each dawn, temple priests rekindle their altars with purified sunlight captured at sunrise, ensuring the god’s flame
          never fades.</p>

        <h2>Njord</h2>
        <p>
          In the pantheon of Skazka, Njord, the God of Storms and Anger, reigns as a roaring tempest. He is the
          embodiment of raw power and unbound fury — most akin to Kaos among the Annarr. Njord is neither savior nor destroyer by
          intent, but rather a force that challenges mortals to seize strength, seize power, or be swept away.
        </p>
        <h3>Symbols</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Cracked Helm of Thunder</b>: Forged from storm clouds and lightning, this helm echoes with thunder whenever Njord rages.</li>
          <li>
            <b>Stormreaver Trident</b>: A jagged weapon that harnesses wind, sea, and electric fury — calling hurricanes or calming
            catastrophic deluges at his will.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Stormcloak of Roaring Gales</b>: A cloak woven from gale-force winds and vaporous clouds. It whips around him in battle,
            tearing at foes and stirring courage in allies.
          </li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Domains</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Storm & Fury</b>: Njord commands lightning, roaring winds, and crushing waves. Sailors dread and respect his presence: appease him, and
            he grants safe passage; defy him, and ships vanish in whirlpools.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Anger & Resolve</b>: In his rage, Njord symbolizes both the destructive and galvanizing power of anger. He punishes those weak of
            conviction and empowers those who channel rage into action.
          </li>
          <b>Power & Meritocracy</b>: He embodies the survival-of-the-fittest ethos: power carved through struggle and borne by those who endure. He brooks
          no excuses or charity; only the strong earn his favor.
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Rites</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>The Siege of Stormkeep</b>: When Orcs besieged the coastal fortress of Stormkeep, Njord unleashed a week-long tempest. Waves battered the
            walls, lightning shattered siege towers, and only those defenders proven in battle earned spared lives. The story ends
            with the surviving knights swearing oaths under thunder to never yield.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>The Trial of the Roaring Shore</b>: A rite of passage for warriors and sailors. They stand on the high cliffs as storms surge around them. Those who hold
            steady and return victorious are said to have Njord’s grit; those who falter are cast out — literally washed away by the
            returning tide. Those that fail are said to rise as 'The Drowned' - an undead creature bound to some Njord for eternity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Festival of the Wrathwind</b>: On the equinoxes, massive bonfires are lit along the coasts. Those that build these fires test their skill at keeping the fires
            alight during the storm. A blessing is said to be received - the Storm Kiss - by any who keep their watchfires going until dawn.
