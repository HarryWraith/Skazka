            <p>A land forged in myth, ruled by mystery, and whispered about in forgotten tongues. Here, ancient
                creatures stir beneath moonlit forests, and the stars themselves bleed secrets into the night. This
                is no place for the faint of heart.</p>
            <p>Within these cursed realms, every tale is a trap, every wonder a warning. Yet those brave enough to
                adventure here may uncover lost legends, forbidden magic, and truths too terrible to remain buried.
            </p>
            <p>But be warned - stories don't always have happy endings. </p>

            <h2 class="skz-viking">Western continent: Skia</h2>
            <p>
                Once remembered only in the oral traditions of the Sken, Skia was home
                to humans enslaved by giants—the offspring of the ancient Gods. When
                the Gods abandoned them, the giants waged war among themselves. Freed
                from bondage, humanity cultivated the land, tended livestock, and
                mined the earth. Their unquenchable curiosity drove them onward—across
                hills, beneath mountains, into the unknown. Alarmed by humans’
                ambition, the Gods debated intervention but ultimately stood by as
                humans awakened a primeval force—greater than even the gods
                themselves. Terrified, humanity fled eastward in search of a mythical
                sanctuary.

            <h2 class="skz-viking">Eastern continent: Kelos</h2>
            <p>
                Spanning from temperate zones to the Arctic, Kelos offers a tapestry
                of landscapes—from frozen tundras to scorching deserts. It hosts over
                a dozen intelligent species: ancient Dwarves once favored by gods,
                fierce Orc tribes bred for war, graceful Elves, cunning Goblins and
                Kobolds, and a myriad of Beast Folk. Their cultures and histories
                intertwine across thousands of years.

            <h2 class="skz-viking">The Serydina Isles</h2>
            <p>
                Just days’ sail west of Kelos lie the Serydina Isles, a small
                archipelago centered on the island of Snuuflund. Several of its isles
                are populated, while others serve as home to only sheep and goats.

            <h2 class="skz-viking">Oy: the mythical island of the gods</h2>
            <p>
                Oy is whispered to be the long-lost abode of the first Gods—a place of
                myth and mystery. Archaeologists and theolurgists argue heatedly over
                its nature: whether it exists physically on Skazka, or lies beyond the
                veil, only reachable by those who truly believe.
