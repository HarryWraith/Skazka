                <p>A land forged in myth, ruled by mystery, and whispered about in forgotten tongues. Here, ancient
                    creatures stir beneath moonlit forests, and the stars themselves bleed secrets into the night.
                    This
                    is no place for the faint of heart.</p>
                <p>Within these cursed realms, every tale is a trap, every wonder a warning. Yet those brave enough
                    to
                    adventure here may uncover lost legends, forbidden magic, and truths too terrible to remain
                    buried.
                    But be warned - stories don't always have happy endings.</p>

                <h3 class="tb-title">Western continent: Skia</h3>
                <p>Now remembered only in the oral traditions of the Sken, Skia was home to humans enslaved by
                    giants—the offspring of the ancient Gods. When the Gods abandoned them, the giants waged war among
                    themselves. Freed from bondage, humanity cultivated the land, tended livestock, and mined the earth.
                    Their unquenchable curiosity drove them onward—across hills, beneath mountains, into the unknown.
                </p>
                <p>Alarmed by humans’ ambition, the Gods debated intervention but ultimately stood by as humans awakened
                    something &ndash; something terrible. Terrified, humanity fled eastward in search
                    of a mythical sanctuary.</p>

                    Archaeologists and theolurgists argue heatedly over its nature: whether it exists physically on
                    Skazka, or lies beyond the veil, only reachable by those who truly believe. Some have set out
                    in search of it, but none have returned to reveal its location.</p>
