                <p>Skazka is a vast world where roughly 60% of the surface is covered by water or ice. There are two continents
                    separated by a vast ocean filled with danger, mystery and unexplored islands. Skia, the western continent's location
                    has been lost to all but the collective memory of the Sken, who traversed the great ocean to reach Snuuflund far to
                    the east. The Eastern continent, Kelos, is populated by the races of more than a dozen peoples. Goblins, Kobolds,
                    Elves, Dwarves, and Beast Folk, all call Kelos home.</p>

            <img src="assets/skia.jpg" alt="the western continent of Skia">
            <h2>Western continent: Skia</h2>
            <p>Little is known of the western continent except what is retold in the oral traditions of the Sken. Skia was once home
                to men who were servants to the giants; the children of the old Gods. But the Gods abandoned their children and the
                giants turned to infighting. As man grew in number the giants were no longer able to hold them in servitude. The
                giants headed north to the mountains and took refuge in the vast fortresses of ice.</p>
            <p>Man learned to tend crops, herd cattle and mine the earth. They were quick learners and soon held mastery over their
                domain. But they were not satisfied with their lot and turned to exploration. Further, higher and deeper, they went.
                Their knowledge grew and the Gods took note. They could not allow man to become too knowledgeable lest they seek
                godhood themselves.</p>
            <p>The Gods argued bitterly on what should be done. But ultimately they chose to do nothing, thinking that man's
                brazeness would be his undoing. These stories are now the stuff of legend: half truth and half myth. What is beyond
                refute is that man awoke something perhaps as old as the Gods. Something so terrible that they abandoned their
                homes, farms and mines, and fled east in search of a land that was just a myth to them.</p>

            <h2>Eastern continent: Kelos</h2>
            <p>The continent of Kelos sits between the equator and the north pole of the planet. Consequently, this vast
                continent has many biomes. From the harsh glaciers of the far north to the parched desert at the most southerly
                tip of the continent, temperatures range from one extreme to the other.</p>
            <p>As much variety can also be seen again in the inhabitants of Kelos. From the ancient Dwarves that once served as
                Smiths to the Gods to the Orc tribes created for war, the races of Kelos have a rich and colourful history that
                spans thousands of years.</p>

            <h2>The Serydina Isles</h2>
            <p>These are a small chain of islands a days voyage off the west coast of Kelos. Snuuflund is the largest of these
                isles, but there are several others that are inhabited as well as number of smaller islands only frequented by
                sheep and other species of animal.</p>

            <h2>Oy: the mythical island of the gods</h2>
            <p>Oy is the mythical home of the first Gods. Its existence is a hotly debated subject among both theolurgens and
                archeologists. Some argue that Oy physically exists on Skazka while others believe that it is not on Skazka, but
                rather connected to it in some way.</p>
