      <p>Leonarah was born daughter of Aderion Vey, a merchant-lord whose
        caravans brought silk, gold, and rare ironwood across half the known world. Her childhood was gilded, her days
        filled with
        the music of foreign minstrels and the scent of cinnamon from far ports. But when civil war split the empire
        in two, her father refused the Emperor’s summons, sending neither coin nor sword to the throne. For this defiance,
        he
        was executed in the public square, his body left for the carrion birds. Leonarah’s ancestral manors were seized, her
        ships burned, and she herself sold into the slave pits of Virethane. There, in the blood-soaked sand, she learned
        the
        art of killing, rising from a nameless captive to the arena’s undefeated champion, called The Crimson Mantle for the
        cloak she wore woven from her own fallen foes’ banners. Her fame grew until whispers reached the palace itself —
        whispers of a warrior who fought like a storm given form. On the day she faced the Emperor in his private arena, her
        spear found his heart, ending his reign. But as prophecy had long foretold, her victory demanded the price of her
        life; she fell moments later, her blood mingling with his upon the marble floor. In death, the gods of strife
        claimed
        her, and the people began to pray to Leonarah — the mortal who defied an empire, now immortal patroness of warriors
        who rise from ruin to glory.</p>

        <li><b>The Bloodmother’s Feast</b>: After victory, soldiers offer the first cut of roasted meat to Leonarah, placing
          it upon a stone altar or burying it at the camp’s edge.</li>
        <li><b>The Rite of the Last Stand</b>: When defeat is inevitable, her faithful fight in a tight circle formation until
          none remain, believing Leonarah will lead their spirits to her hall.</li>
        <li><b>The Broken Blade Ceremony</b>: When a warrior retires, they break their sword and cast half into a river,
          symbolizing the end of their service to Leonarah. The other half is kept as a family heirloom.</li>

      <ul class="nodec">
        <li>
         She is often depicted with Vorgath, a great black wolf who feeds on the fear of her
          enemies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Those who die in battle with courage are brought to her hall, where the dead fight
          in endless contests, each dawn bringing fresh scars and fresh glory.
        </li>
        <li>
          She once fought the Sea God, Morthain, for seven days upon the beaches of the Storm
          Coast; her blood turned the tide red for generations, and the place is still sacred to her worshippers.
        </li>
        <li>
           It is said that the moment before an army breaks, Leonarah’s whisper can be heard —
          those who hear it either find impossible courage or fall into despair, depending on their worth.
