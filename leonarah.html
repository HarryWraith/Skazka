      <!-- ===== Overview ===== -->
      <h2 id="overview" class="tb-title">Overview</h2>
      <p>Leonarah was born daughter of Aderion Vey, a merchant-lord whose caravans brought silk, gold, and rare ironwood
        across half the known world. Her childhood was gilded, her days filled with the music of foreign minstrels and
        the scent of cinnamon from far ports. But when civil war split the empire in two, her father refused the
        Emperor’s summons, sending neither coin nor sword to the throne. For this defiance, he was executed in the
        public square, his body left for the carrion birds. Leonarah’s ancestral manors were seized, her ships burned,
        and she herself sold into the slave pits of Virethane. There, in the blood-soaked sand, she learned the art of
        killing, rising from a nameless captive to the arena’s undefeated champion, called The Crimson Mantle for the
        cloak she wore woven from her own fallen foes’ banners. Her fame grew until whispers reached the palace itself —
        whispers of a warrior who fought like a storm given form. On the day she faced the Emperor in his private arena,
        her spear found his heart, ending his reign. But as prophecy had long foretold, her victory demanded the price
        of her life; she fell moments later, her blood mingling with his upon the marble floor. In death, the gods of
        strife claimed her, and the people began to pray to Leonarah — the mortal who defied an empire, now immortal
        patroness of warriors who rise from ruin to glory.</p>
