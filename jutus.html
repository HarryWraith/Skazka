            <h3>Symbols</h3>
      <ul class="nodec">
        <li><b>The broken shackle</b>: A length of heavy iron chain with one link deliberately shattered, often depicted with golden light streaming through the break. This symbol represents liberation from bondage and divine authority, as well as Jutus's role in the dwarven escape. It serves as both a reminder of his "failure" and a badge of honor for those who fight against oppression.</li>
        <li><b>The hooded messenger</b>: A cloaked figure carrying a staff topped with wings, but with one wing broken or bent. The hood obscures the face, representing anonymity and the hidden nature of divine intervention. The broken wing symbolizes Jutus's diminished status while the staff represents his continued role as messenger between realms.</li>
        <li><b>The lockpick</b>: An ornate skeleton key twisted into the shape of a lockpick, often crafted from tarnished silver or brass. This symbol represents Jutus's ability to open doors both literal and metaphorical - unlocking opportunities for mortals while also suggesting his thieving nature and his talent for bypassing divine restrictions.</li>

      <p>Jutus embodies the complex nature of a fallen deity seeking redemption and revenge in equal measure. Once the mighty Lord of the Underworld and Protector of Oy, his divine status was stripped away as punishment for allowing the dwarven people to break free from their divine indenture, reducing him to the role of mere messenger between gods and mortals. This demotion has left him bitter yet compassionate, caught between his divine nature and mortal concerns in a way that makes him uniquely invested in the struggles of everyday people. Often manifesting as a common thief or wandering rogue, Jutus moves through the world with the practiced stealth of one who has learned to operate in shadows, both literal and metaphorical. His resentment toward his fellow deities drives him to subtly undermine their grand designs while simultaneously offering aid to mortals who face injustice or oppression. Unlike other gods who view mortals as distant subjects, Jutus sees them as kindred spirits - beings trapped by circumstances beyond their control, struggling against forces far greater than themselves. This perspective makes him perhaps the most approachable of all deities, though his help often comes with the understanding that he expects mortals to help themselves as well.</p>

            <h3>Rites</h3>
      <ul class="nodec">
        <li><b>Rite of unbinding</b>: Performed at dawn on the anniversary of the dwarven liberation, this ceremony involves participants symbolically breaking chains, locks, or bonds while reciting the names of those who have been freed from oppression. The ritual requires genuine acts of liberation - freeing a slave, helping someone escape an abusive situation, or breaking unjust laws. Successful completion grants Jutus's blessing for endeavors involving freedom and escape, and sometimes provides prophetic dreams about trapped souls who need assistance.</li>
        <li><b>The messengers gambit</b>: A complex ritual involving the delivery of seven messages to seven different recipients without being detected by authorities or divine agents. Each message must contain a truth that the recipient needs to hear but doesn't want to know. The final message is delivered to a temple or shrine of another deity, containing a subtle challenge or criticism of that god's actions. This dangerous rite tests the participant's stealth, courage, and commitment to truth, with successful completion granting enhanced abilities in espionage and divine communication.</li>
        <li><b>The Thiefs confession</b>: Unlike most religious confessions, this rite requires participants to openly admit to acts of theft, deception, or rule-breaking - but only those committed in service of justice or to help the innocent. The confession is made while performing an act of charity or kindness, symbolically balancing the scales. Jutus is said to personally hear these confessions and grant absolution along with guidance for future "necessary crimes" that serve the greater good.</li>

            <h3>Domains</h3>
      <ul class="nodec">
        <li><b>Liberation</b>: Jutus grants power over freedom, escape, and the breaking of bonds both physical and spiritual. Clerics of this domain can unlock doors, break chains, dispel compulsions, and help others escape from prisons, slavery, or magical control. They excel at freeing the oppressed and providing sanctuary for those fleeing tyranny.</li>
        <li><b>Secrets</b>: As a divine messenger who operates in shadows, Jutus governs hidden knowledge, espionage, and information. His clerics can uncover lies, gather intelligence, communicate across vast distances, and protect sensitive information. They serve as spies, investigators, and keepers of dangerous truths that could topple kingdoms or embarrass gods.</li>
        <li><b>Retribution</b>: Born from his resentment toward his divine punishment, this domain channels righteous anger against injustice and the settling of scores. Clerics can track down wrongdoers, ensure that crimes don't go unpunished, and turn the schemes of the powerful against themselves. This domain also governs the protection of whistleblowers and those who speak truth to power.</li>
      </ul>

        <article> <h3>Lore</h3>
      <ul class="nodec">
        <li>Ancient texts describe how Jutus was once among the most trusted of the divine council, serving as Lord of the Underworld with absolute authority over the realm of the dead and sworn protector of the realm of Oy. His downfall came when he discovered that the gods had bound the dwarven race into eternal servitude through trickery and divine coercion. Unable to stomach this injustice, Jutus secretly provided the dwarves with the knowledge and tools needed to break their divine bonds and escape to freedom. When the gods discovered his "betrayal," they stripped away most of his power and demoted him to the humiliating role of divine messenger - a constant reminder of his rebellion and a warning to other deities about the price of defying the divine order.</li>
        <li>Jutus is said to maintain a vast network of mortal agents, thieves, rebels, and outcasts who serve his goals of undermining divine tyranny and helping the oppressed. These agents, known as "Jutus's Keys," operate in secret throughout the world, identifying injustices and working to correct them through stealth, sabotage, and subversion. The network communicates through a complex system of coded messages, hidden symbols, and dead drops that even divine magic struggles to fully penetrate. Many members don't even know they serve Jutus, believing themselves to be part of various secular resistance movements or thieves' guilds.</li>
        <li>Drow seers and divine oracles speak of a prophecy stating that Jutus will one day deliver a message so powerful and revelatory that it will shake the very foundations of the divine order. This "Final Message" is said to contain the true names and hidden shames of all the gods, their secret weaknesses, and the ultimate truth about the nature of divinity itself. The prophecy claims that when this message is delivered, mortals will finally understand that gods are not infallible beings worthy of worship, but flawed entities who have simply accumulated power over time. Some scholars believe Jutus has been working toward this revelation for centuries, gathering divine secrets through his messenger role and waiting for the perfect moment to expose the gods' hypocrisy to the world.</li>
