      <!-- ===== Overview ===== -->
      <h2 id="overview" class="tb-title">Overview</h2>
      <p>Jutus embodies the complex nature of a fallen deity seeking redemption and revenge in equal measure. Once the
        mighty Lord of the Underworld and Protector of Oy, his divine status was stripped away as punishment for
        allowing the dwarven people to break free from their divine indenture, reducing him to the role of mere
        messenger between gods and mortals. This demotion has left him bitter yet compassionate, caught between his
        divine nature and mortal concerns in a way that makes him uniquely invested in the struggles of everyday people.
        Often manifesting as a common thief or wandering rogue, Jutus moves through the world with the practiced stealth
        of one who has learned to operate in shadows, both literal and metaphorical. His resentment toward his fellow
        deities drives him to subtly undermine their grand designs while simultaneously offering aid to mortals who face
        injustice or oppression. Unlike other gods who view mortals as distant subjects, Jutus sees them as kindred
        spirits - beings trapped by circumstances beyond their control, struggling against forces far greater than
        themselves. This perspective makes him perhaps the most approachable of all deities, though his help often comes
        with the understanding that he expects mortals to help themselves as well.

          as spies and whisper-keepers.</li>

        <li><strong>Broken Shackle</strong>: A heavy chain with one shattered link, gold light bleeding from the
          break—emblem of liberation, Jutus’s dwarven deliverance, and a “failed” duty worn as honor.</li>
        <li><strong>Hooded Messenger</strong>: A faceless, hooded figure with a staff tipped by one broken
          wing—anonymity, hidden aid, diminished rank, and the god’s enduring role as go-between.</li>
        <li><strong>Lockpick</strong>: An ornate skeleton key shaped as a lockpick, in tarnished brass or silver—opening
          doors literal and figurative, sly defiance, and the knack for slipping divine restraints.</li>

          they unmake chains.</li>
        <li>Bear the Hard Message: Carry truths people need—not want—to hear. Speak plainly, move unseen, and let
          revelation humble the mighty.</li>
        <li>Transgress for Justice: Theft, disguise, and deceit are sacraments only when they spare the innocent and

        <li><strong>Rite of Unbinding</strong>: At dawn on the dwarven-liberation anniversary, participants break a
          chain or lock while naming the freed. The rite demands a real act of liberation (e.g., ending abuse, breaking
          unjust law) and earns Jutus’s blessing—and sometimes dreams of souls needing rescue.</li>
        <li><strong>The Messenger’s Gambit</strong>: Deliver seven truths to seven recipients without detection; the
          last is a veiled challenge left at another god’s shrine. Success hones stealth, espionage, and divine
          messaging.</li>
        <li><strong>The Thief’s Confession</strong>: Publicly confess crimes done for justice while performing charity
          to balance the scales. Jutus grants absolution and guidance for future “necessary” transgressions.</li>

      <p>
        Ancient texts describe how Jutus was once among the most trusted of the divine council, serving as Lord of the
        Underworld with absolute authority over the realm of the dead and sworn protector of the realm of Oy. His
        downfall came when he discovered that the gods had bound the dwarven race into eternal servitude through
        trickery and divine coercion. Unable to stomach this injustice, Jutus secretly provided the dwarves with the
        knowledge and tools needed to break their divine bonds and escape to freedom. When the gods discovered his
        "betrayal," they stripped away most of his power and demoted him to the humiliating role of divine messenger - a
        constant reminder of his rebellion and a warning to other deities about the price of defying the divine order.
