            <p>
                Among all the Prir and twisted divines that haunt Skazka’s mythic past, Chernabog is the shadow cast by hope
                itself. Once a forsaken mortal, cursed by fate or Kaos itself, he became god not by ascension, but through
                corruption, hatred, and the mockery of divine pity. Chernabog is misfortune made incarnate: cold, inevitable,
                and patient.

      <ul class="nodec">
        <li><b>The Mask of Ruin</b>: Said to be worn by Chernabog when walking among mortals. It bears no eyes, only a
          faint
          smile. It is now a symbol worn by priests of this deity.</li>
        <li><b>Ashblade</b>: A sword carried by his earliest orc warlords, forged from volcanic glass and regret. It
          breaks
          not bodies, but loyalty. Said to be used to ordain priests in to the ranks of Chernabog.</li>
        <li><b>The Thousand Whispers</b>: A forbidden prayer spoken only by those who have lost everything. The prayer
          does
          not ask for aid — it asks for vengeance through entropy.</li>

        <li><b>Misfortune</b>: Wherever luck turns bitter and triumphs collapse, Chernabog walks unseen.</li>
        <li><b>Despair</b>: Not raw destruction, but carefully sown ruin—turning hope to ash and bonds to blades.</li>
        <li><b>Corruption</b>: He is not the chaos of Kaos, but its precision; a seed of rot planted in systems and
          souls.
        </li>
        <li><b>Creation of Monsters</b>: From his rage, he forged the orcs—brutal reflections of his own exile.</li>

            <h3>Lore</h3>
      <ul class="nodec">
        <li>On a far off world, Chernabog shaped the first orc from stone, ash,
          and raw will. He did not gift them purpose — he gave them anger. Their hearts burn with echoes of Chernabog’s
          first scream.</li>
        <li>When the orcs flooded from his sanctum, no god knew where the tide would end. Cities
          vanished beneath choking smoke. Chernabog himself never lifted a blade — he whispered, and kings tore down
          their own thrones.</li>
        <li>Chernabog is not worshipped openly. His name is muttered only by the
          broken—prisoners,
          the plague-touched, exiled warlords. Secret cults called The Hollowed Eye plant despair deliberately,
          believing
          that only ruin brings truth.</li>
