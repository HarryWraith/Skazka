            <h2 class="tb-title">Age of the Sun</h2>
            <p>The era before Starfall is commonly known as the Age of Sun. Written records from this period are scarce
                and come almost exclusively from Elven or Dwarven sources. The farther back in time one looks, the more
                legendary and embellished both spoken and written accounts become. As a result, much of the history of
                the Age of Sun is considered mythical, and any dates associated with it should be treated as rough
                approximations rather than precise facts.</p>
            <h2 class="tb-title">Timekeeping</h2>
            <p>Skazka rotates fully around its sun once every twenty-four hours. Most inhabitants structure their daily
                lives around the natural cycle of daylight. While clocks and watches do not exist, people commonly mark
                time using recognizable phases of the day, such as sunrise, high sun, sundown, and midnight,
                coordinating activities and events according to these natural cues.</p>

            <p>The current year on Skazka is 972. Time here is measured relative to a pivotal event known as the
                Starfall, which occurred 971 years ago. This cataclysmic celestial collision ushered in the Age of
                Ice,
                a period of harsh winters, frozen landscapes, and the awakening of dragons and the Dragonborn. The
                Age
                of Ice endured for centuries, shaping civilizations and altering the balance of power across the
                world.

            <p>In the year 695, the Shadow War erupted, marking the beginning of the current era, the Age of Shadow. -
