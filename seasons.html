            <h2>Age of the Sun</h2>
            <p>The era before Starfall is commonly known as the Age of Sun. Written records from this period are scarce and come almost exclusively from Elven or Dwarven sources. The farther back in time one looks, the more legendary and embellished both spoken and written accounts become. As a result, much of the history of the Age of Sun is considered mythical, and any dates associated with it should be treated as rough approximations rather than precise facts.</p>
             <h2>Timekeeping</h2>
            <p>Skazka rotates fully around its sun once every twenty-four hours. Most inhabitants structure their daily lives around the natural cycle of daylight. While clocks and watches do not exist, people commonly mark time using recognizable phases of the day, such as sunrise, high sun, sundown, and midnight, coordinating activities and events according to these natural cues.</p>

            <p>The current year on Skazka is 972. Time here is measured relative to a pivotal event known as the Starfall, which occurred 971 years ago. This cataclysmic celestial collision ushered in the Age of Ice, a period of harsh winters, frozen landscapes, and the awakening of dragons and the Dragonborn. The Age of Ice endured for centuries, shaping civilizations and altering the balance of power across the world.</p>
            <p>In the year 713, the Shadow War erupted, bringing an end to the Age of Ice and marking the beginning of the current era, the Age of Shadow. Since then, Skazka has been shaped by conflict, intrigue, and the lingering echoes of Starfall, a reminder of the cosmic forces that continue to shape the world.</p>
