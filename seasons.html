            <p>
                The era before Starfall is commonly known as the Age of Sun. Written records from this period are scarce
                and come almost exclusively from Elven or Dwarven sources. The farther back in time one looks, the more
                legendary and embellished both spoken and written accounts become. As a result, much of the history of
                the Age of Sun is considered mythical, and any dates associated with it should be treated as rough
                approximations rather than precise facts.

            <p>
                Skazka rotates fully around its sun once every twenty-four hours. Most inhabitants structure their daily
                lives around the natural cycle of daylight. While clocks and watches do not exist, people commonly mark
                time using recognizable phases of the day, such as sunrise, high sun, sundown, and midnight,
                coordinating activities and events according to these natural cues.
