      <ul class="nodec">
        <li><b>The Hollow Spiral</b>: a coiled dragon tail curling inward into nothingness, representing hunger and inevitability.</li>
        <li><b>The cracked eye</b>: a reptilian eye split down the middle, its pupil replaced by a starless void.</li>
        <li><b>The cursed fang</b>: a tooth or fang wrapped in faint runes, always drawn dripping with black ichor.</li>

            <p>Fafnirog, the Void Dragon, is an abomination who slew the primal god Uzume at the behest of Kaos. He is sustained by devotion. Cloaked in silence and entropy, Fafnirog devours memory and unravels the divine, his presence marked by the omen of a black star that drains warmth from the world. His symbols—the Hollow Spiral, the Cracked Eye, and the Ashen Fang—embody hunger and erasure, while his rites demand silence, sacrifice, and the surrender of self. Worshiped by warlocks and others who crave unmaking, he is a hollow dragon of absence, eternally teetering between oblivion and godhood, feeding only on those who dare to bind themselves to his abyss.</p>

            <h3>Rites</h3>
      <ul class="nodec">
        <li><b>Rite of hollow breath</b>: A warlock inhales incense made from ground dragon bone and exhales into a vessel of water, creating a blackened surface where visions of forgotten truths appear.</li>
        <li><b>Rite of fang offering</b>: Each initiate must break one tooth from their own mouth, stain it with blood, and cast it into flame; in return, they gain whispers from the Void Dragon in dreams.</li>
        <li><b>Rite of silent vigil</b>: Devotees must sit in perfect silence for three nights under the stars, neither eating nor speaking. On the dawn of the fourth day, the first word spoken aloud becomes a vow bound to the Dragon.</li>
      </ul>

            <h3>Domains</h3>
      <ul class="nodec">
        <li><b>Silence (unmaking)</b>: His followers learn that silence is the truest prayer; power comes from the erasure of names, songs, and stories.</li>
        <li><b>Entropy (decay of the divine)</b>: They harness the weakness of gods and strongholds, unraveling divine wards and sanctities.</li>
        <li><b>Psychic feeding</b>: His warlocks can strip memories from others and offer them to their patron as nourishment.</li>
      </ul>

             <h3>Lore</h3>
      <ul class="nodec">
        <li>Unlike gods who embody ideals, the Void Dragon embodies absence. He does not create; he consumes. Every follower whispers their own ending into him, making him stronger, yet less real—always on the brink of unraveling.</li>
        <li>When the Dragon is worshiped in great numbers, a black star appears in the sky. Its light brings no warmth, only omen: crops fail, shadows lengthen, and divine prayers go unanswered.</li>
      </ul>
