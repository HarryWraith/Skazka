      <!-- ===== Overview ===== -->
      <h2 id="overview" class="tb-title">Overview</h2>
      <p>Once a cunning archdevil in the infernal hierarchy, Cormarin’s mortal origins are shrouded in rumor, whispered
        in dark corners of the planes: he was a man who first tasted the sting of betrayal and, in that crucible,
        discovered a hunger for power stronger than loyalty. In life, he wove schemes so intricate that even his
        infernal masters envied them, but his ambition outstripped his cunning—he sought not servitude but dominion.
        Cast from the Nine Hells for plotting to enslave a legion of devils, his soul, fragmented and burning with
        resentment, seeped into the dreamscape, twisting itself around mortal fears and sorrows. Each whispered
        nightmare, each sleepless night, fed his essence until mortals began to feel his presence even when asleep. Pain
        and self-loathing, once personal afflictions, became divine instruments, and through the collective anguish of
        those who scorned his followers, Cormarin ascended—not through worship, but through the very suffering he had
        mastered, forging a god from a devil and a man’s darkest torment.</p>

          skin, channeling physical pain into spiritual devotion.</li>
        <li><strong>Nightmare Communion</strong>: a ritual where worshippers sleep in a sacred circle, willingly

        where Cormarin offers them the choice to serve him or be eternally tormented by their own regrets.
