      <p>Once a cunning archdevil in the infernal hierarchy, Cormarin’s mortal origins are shrouded in rumor, whispered in
        dark corners of the planes: he was a man who first tasted the sting of betrayal and, in that crucible, discovered a
        hunger for power stronger than loyalty. In life, he wove schemes so intricate that even his infernal masters envied
        them, but his ambition outstripped his cunning—he sought not servitude but dominion. Cast from the Nine Hells for
        plotting to enslave a legion of devils, his soul, fragmented and burning with resentment, seeped into the dreamscape,
        twisting itself around mortal fears and sorrows. Each whispered nightmare, each sleepless night, fed his essence until
        mortals began to feel his presence even when asleep. Pain and self-loathing, once personal afflictions, became divine
        instruments, and through the collective anguish of those who scorned his followers, Cormarin ascended—not through
        worship, but through the very suffering he had mastered, forging a god from a devil and a man’s darkest torment.</p>

        <li>
          It is said that anyone who dies in a state of self-loathing may find their soul pulled to the Nightmare Plane, where Cormarin offers them the choice to serve him or be eternally tormented by their own regrets.
        </li>
        <li>
          Legends claim that entire cities once fell into despair because Cormarin cursed their dreams after their leaders betrayed his mortal followers, leaving waking terror as his silent, divine judgment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some scholars whisper that Cormarin still harbors a fragment of his mortal ambition, plotting through dreams to one day reforge himself into a being capable of returning to the material plane, not as a devil, but as a god of fear incarnate.
