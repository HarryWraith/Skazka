        <li><b>Moonlit Wolfsbane Crown</b>: A circlet of silvery wolf-tooth and moonflower, signifying her bond with
          lupine
          creatures and the moonlit chill of winter nights.</li>

        <li><b>Glacial Spear</b>: A spear of living ice that never melts, used to mark her domain over frozen lands and
          to
          challenge the worthy.</li>

        <li><b>Hunting Cloak</b>: Hidden within its fur-lined seams, she carries a wolf pelt that she wraps around

      <p> Skald emerges as the austere Goddess of Winter and steadfast Protector of Wolves. Draped in fur-trimmed pelts,
        her
        presence is as crisp and biting as the first frost — distant yet undeniable, her power carved from the
        unforgiving
        cold. She is neither benevolent nor malevolent, but a primordial force championing survival of the fittest and
        believing in the autonomy of mortals to determine their destinies.</p>

      <ul class="nodec">
        <li><b>The Hunt of the White Night</b>: On the coldest night before the winter solstice, hunters seek her favor.
          They enter
          thawing forests at midnight, tracking a lone white wolf said to be an avatar of Skald. To slay it would invite
          her
          wrath; to let it pass honors the goddess — and offers glimpses of their own strength.</li>

        <li><b>The Frost-Bound Oath</b>: When new wolf pups are born under deep snow, packs leave a single white feather
          on their
          den's threshold — a pact recognizing Skald’s guidance and promising to follow the strongest among them without
          question.</li>

        <li><b>Feast of the Frozen Thaw</b>: At the cusp of spring, tribes gather meat from their hunting seasons —
          smoked and
          preserved. They form a circle by the great fire, sharing stories of winter’s trials. One 'lone wolf' prowls
          the
          edges serving as Skald’s presence. Survivors return to hearths with renewed respect for both natural order and
          their own resilience.</li>

      <ul class="nodec">
        <li><b>Winter’s Challenge</b>: Skald governs the biting cold, fierce snowstorms, and long polar nights. Hunters
          and herders
          whisper appeals to her for guidance through blizzards — but they know she offers no mercy, only truth.</li>
        <li><b>Guardian of the Pack</b>: Wolves roam freely under her watch, their howls the echo of her voice. She
          teaches that
          unity and strength breed survival — yet only the strongest wolves lead the pack, unworthy ones cast out.</li>
        <li><b>Mortal Autonomy</b>: Skald holds a hands-off philosophy - races must forge their own paths. She
          intervenes only when
          natural order demands it — be it famine, animal migrations, or beasts turned rabid. In her view, self-reliance
          is
          the highest virtue.</li>

      <ul class="nodec">
        <li>When the first winter settled over Skazka, mortals feared the long night would consume them. Skald appeared
          in the guise of a great white wolf, her breath freezing the air into crystalline mist. She struck her fang
          into a stone and split it, revealing fire trapped within. From that day, her wolves carried embers between
          villages, teaching humans how to endure the cold. Hunters still carve a single wolf’s fang into their blades,
          believing it channels her silent promise: winter may bite, but it also teaches survival.</li>
        <li>It is said that the stillness after the season’s first snowfall is Skald’s voice. Her silence falls over
          forests and mountains alike, warning all creatures to respect the balance of predator and prey. To speak too
          loudly, or to take more than one needs, risks her ire. In folktales, greedy hunters who ignored the silence
          vanished into drifts, never to return. Elders teach children that if they cup their hands to the snow and
          listen, they might hear the faint growl of Skald’s wolves guarding the world’s balance.</li>
        <li>Once each winter, under the silver crown of the full moon, Skald is said to lead her spectral wolf pack
          across the frozen skies. Their paws spark like falling stars as they hunt the souls of oathbreakers, cowards,
          and those who profane the wild. Villagers tell of waking to find wolf-tracks scorched into their rooftops or
          the snow outside their doors pressed with paw prints too large for any mortal beast. Survivors of harsh
          winters often whisper that Skald’s wolves ran beside them unseen, driving away despair until the dawn.</li>
