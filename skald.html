      <!-- ===== Overview ===== -->
      <h2 id="overview" class="tb-title">Overview</h2>
      <p>Skald emerges as the austere Goddess of Winter and steadfast Protector of Wolves. Draped in fur-trimmed pelts,
        her presence is as crisp and biting as the first frost — distant yet undeniable, her power carved from the
        unforgiving cold. She is neither benevolent nor malevolent, but a primordial force championing survival of the
        fittest and believing in the autonomy of mortals to determine their destinies.</p>

 ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="domains">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Influence</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Winter’s Challenge</strong>: Skald governs the biting cold, fierce snowstorms, and long polar
          nights. Hunters and herders whisper appeals to her for guidance through blizzards — but they know she offers
          no mercy, only truth.</li>
        <li><strong>Guardian of the Pack</strong>: : Wolves roam freely under her watch, their howls the echo of her
          voice. She teaches that unity and strength breed survival — yet only the strongest wolves lead the pack,
          unworthy ones cast out.</li>
        <li><strong>Mortal Autonomy</strong>: : Skald holds a hands-off philosophy - races must forge their own paths.
          She intervenes only when natural order demands it — be it famine, animal migrations, or beasts turned rabid.
          In her view, self-reliance is the highest virtue.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Symbols & Omens ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="symbols">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Symbols</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Moonlit Wolfsbane Crown</strong>: A circlet of silvery wolf-tooth and moonflower, signifying her bond
          with lupine creatures and the moonlit chill of winter nights.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Glacial Spear</strong>: A spear of living ice that never melts, used to mark her domain over frozen
          lands and to challenge the worthy.
          fertility blooms nearby.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hunting Cloak</strong>: Hidden within its fur-lined seams, she carries a wolf pelt that she wraps
          around weakened spirits — offering either resurrection or reassurance that only the strong prevail.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <!-- ===== Tenets ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="tenets">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Tenets</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Endure the long night—winter owes you nothing.
        </li>
        <li>Honor the pack; let the strongest lead.</li>
        <li>Take only what you need; leave the wild unbroken.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Rites & Offerings ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="rites">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Rites</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Hunt of the White Night</strong>: On the coldest night before the winter solstice, hunters seek
          her favor. They enter thawing forests at midnight, tracking a lone white wolf said to be an avatar of Skald.
          To slay it would invite her wrath; to let it pass honors the goddess — and offers glimpses of their own
          strength.</li>
        <li><strong>The Frost-Bound Oath</strong>: When new wolf pups are born under deep snow, packs leave a single
          white feather on their den's threshold — a pact recognizing Skald’s guidance and promising to follow the
          strongest among them without question.</li>
        <li><strong>Feast of the Frozen Thaw</strong>: At the cusp of spring, tribes gather meat from their hunting
          seasons — smoked and preserved. They form a circle by the great fire, sharing stories of winter’s trials. One
          'lone wolf' prowls the edges serving as Skald’s presence. Survivors return to hearths with renewed respect for
          both natural order and their own resilience.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Avatars & Interventions ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="avatars">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Avatars</h2>
      <p>Skald’s avatar walks the world as a great white wolf—moon-pale eyes, breath that frosts the air, and pawprints
        that glaze into rime—appearing when winters turn cruel to measure a people’s worth rather than to spare them.
        She runs at the edge of blizzards with a spectral pack, guiding the strong, culling the reckless, and enforcing
        the old balance of hunter and prey; roofs found tracked after a full moon, a lone white wolf passing
        unchallenged before the solstice, or a carved fang left at a threshold are taken as her signs. Those she favours
        feel a hard blessing—clarity in the dark, stamina through the long night, and the sense of unseen footfalls at
        their backs—while those who betray the pack or steal more than they need are harried by silence, cold, and
        prints too large for any mortal beast.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== Lore ===== -->
    <div class="tb-panel" id="lore">
      <h2 class="tb-title">Lore</h2>
      <p>When the first winter settled over Skazka, mortals feared the long night would consume them. Skald appeared in
        the guise of a great white wolf, her breath freezing the air into crystalline mist. She struck her fang into a
        stone and split it, revealing fire trapped within. From that day, her wolves carried embers between villages,
        teaching humans how to endure the cold. Hunters still carve a single wolf’s fang into their blades, believing it
        channels her silent promise: winter may bite, but it also teaches survival.</p>
