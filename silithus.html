      <p>Silithus, once a mortal of striking beauty and cunning wit, ascended to divinity through Kaos’s dark grace.
        Whispers say his ambition caught the primordial’s eye — Kaos saw in him the perfect vessel for deception. Now
        known as
        Silithus, God of Lies and Deception, he presides over secrets, illusions, and the art of masks. Though
        remarkably
        charismatic, half of his visage is scarred by holy flame — a cruel reminder of his former humanity and the
        powers he
        wields.</p>

        <li><b>Veiling the truth</b>: Spies and informants gather under moonlight, each donning dual masks—half
          pristine,
          half charred—to honor Silithus’s fractured face. A contract is written in disappearing ink; once read and
          bound,
          participants whisper their secret lies into a copper bowl and burn the text, sealing their deceit.</li>

        <li><b>Trial by mirror</b>: Initiates stand before smoky mirrors recounting their greatest falsehood. The
          mirror’s
          surface cracks if the deceit is profound, revealing a deeper hidden image beneath.</li>

        <li><b>Embrace the flames</b>: In sacred temples, acolytes hold live candles to half their own faces; the wax
          burns
          symbolize solidarity with Silithus’s scarred half and devotion to truth’s darker twin.</li>

      <ul class="nodec">
        <li>
          In his mortal life, Silithus was a nobleman renowned for beauty and charm, celebrated for his hypnotic
          eloquence.
          But envy bred ambition — his hunger for influence led him to trafficing in court intrigue, spreading
          whispers that
          toppled kings and built his own power.
        </li>
        <li>
          When Kaos observed these machinations, he deemed Silithus a kindred spirit and offered divinity. The
          ceremony was
          brutal: the flames of Kaos engulfed half of his face, searing flesh and binding his soul to primordial
          deceit.
          Though scarred, Silithus emerged divine, eyes now glimmering with infinite cunning.
        </li>
        <li>
          As a god, he built an empire of shadows: secret guilds, spy networks that stretch across realms, and hidden
          temples
          behind false walls. His followers include intelligence brokers, master spies, illusionists, and those who
          thrive in
          the murk between truth and lie.
        </li>
        <li>
          Yet Silithus remains a paradox. While he champions lies, he values honesty among his own — betrayal within
          his cult
          is punished worse than death. They say he can read truth through silence, unraveling the most elaborate
          deceptions
          with a single glance. His temples are silent labyrinths where whispered secrets echo eternally; those who
          wander in
          uninvited often unravel their own minds.
