            <h4>Physical Description</h4>
            <p>Humans in Skazka are a diverse race, their appearance reflecting the environments that forged them. The nomads of Kaijistan are recognized by their violet eyes, an echo of their vanished desert kingdom, while the Sken raiders of the western waters bear striking blue skin, a mark of their maritime heritage. Caratanians often display the hardy features of mountain folk, their bodies tempered by both war and vineyard labor. The Horse Lords of the endless plains are lean and sun-browned, their bodies honed by constant movement across the grasslands, and the tribes of Mount Echo carry the raw, weathered look of people shaped by fire and volcanic stone. Humanity’s many variations serve as living testaments to their ability to adapt, survive, and thrive in places where other races might falter.</p>

            <p>Humans have become inseparable from the history of Skazka, their story unfolding alongside the realm’s own evolution. They are now the most numerous of the surface-dwelling peoples, not defined by a single culture but by a vast collection of traditions and identities shaped by the landscapes they inhabit. Humanity’s defining trait has always been adaptability, and it is this quality that has allowed them to endure and flourish across the deserts, mountains, seas, and plains of Kelos. Yet, this very flexibility is a double-edged sword—granting them resilience but also leading them down dangerous and often divisive paths.</p>

            <h4>Heritage</h4>
            <p>Every human society in Skazka carries with it the weight of history and legend. The Kaijistani nomads are the descendants of a kingdom lost to the desert sands, their culture built upon memories of vanished gardens and hidden aquifers. The Horse Lords of the west trace their lineage back to ancestors who first tamed horses and learned the language of the wind. The tribes of Mount Echo claim descent from the world’s first humans, their bloodlines interwoven with the worship of the Fire God beneath their volcano. Caratania, rising in the shadow of the Blood Mountains, grounds its identity in the legacy of Hrothgar Bloodlance, hero and vampire-slayer, while the Sken remember their great Exodus across the seas from Skia, a migration that seeded many of Kelos’s modern cultures. In every case, human heritage is a mixture of myth, survival, and memory, shaping both their pride and their vulnerabilities.</p>

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>Though varied in culture, humanity’s motivations often circle around survival, honor, and legacy. The Kaijistani nomads seek not wealth or conquest, but preservation of the sacred waters that sustain their desert lives. For the Horse Lords, freedom itself is the ultimate desire, pursued through mastery of the plains and resistance to permanence. The tribes of Mount Echo live for their god’s awakening, their faith demanding sacrifices both brutal and absolute. Caratanians pursue order and vigilance, driven by a conviction that their mission is divine and eternal, while their vineyards provide the prosperity needed to sustain that mission. The Sken, tied to the sea, desire glory and sustenance in equal measure, raiding as both survival tactic and cultural expression of their belief that the ocean rewards the bold. In all their forms, human desires balance between necessity and ambition, shaping societies that can be both deeply noble and terrifyingly ruthless.</p>
            <h2>Integration into Society</h2>
            <p>Among the peoples of Skazka, humans are both everywhere and nowhere fully unified. Their adaptability has ensured their dominance across the continent, yet it has also fractured them into countless societies with conflicting priorities. Some, like the Caratanians, have built structured kingdoms that interact with other nations through trade, diplomacy, and military might. Others, such as the Horse Lords and the Kaijistani nomads, remain more insular, bound to their lands and ways of life, often clashing with outsiders while occasionally offering knowledge and trade. The Mount Echo tribes, however, stand apart, their violent rituals and unyielding faith leaving little room for peaceful coexistence. Meanwhile, the Sken straddle the line between menace and necessity, their raids feared but their seafaring knowledge indispensable. Taken together, humanity’s role in society is paradoxical: they are the backbone of Skazka’s civilizations and, at the same time, a constant reminder of the chaos that adaptability can breed.</p>
            <h2>The Sken</h2>
            <p>The Sken are the seafaring descendants of a great exodus from the western continent of Skia. Their survival upon the waves forged a people bound to the ocean, their blue-tinted skin marking them as children of the sea. Those who remained in the Serydina Isles developed into fearsome raiders, viewing the sea as both provider and battlefield, while their mainland kin gave rise to many of Kelos’s human nations. For the island Sken, honor and survival are won through daring voyages, swift raids, and unshakable courage in the face of storm and steel.</p>
            <h2>Caratania</h2>
            <p>The Caratanians dwell in the shadow of the Blood Mountains, heirs to a legacy of defiance against the undead horrors that once threatened all of Kelos. Their society is steeped in bloodline and duty, noble houses tracing descent from Hrothgar Bloodlance, the legendary vampire-slayer. United under a vigilant monarchy and the militant Shield of Dawn, Caratania thrives through discipline, faith, and the wealth of its fertile vineyards. To them, prosperity and military strength are inseparable, for both serve the eternal mission of guarding humanity from darkness.</p>
            <h2>The Tribes of Mount Echo</h2>
            <p>At the fiery foot of Mount Echo, the tribes live in fierce devotion to the Fire God they believe slumbers within the volcano. Claiming descent from Skazka’s first humans, they embrace a primal faith that demands sacrifice and blood. Their culture is shaped by ritual cannibalism, volcanic mysticism, and the belief that conquest awaits when their god awakens. Outsiders are rarely welcomed—most who trespass into their lands are taken as offerings, their disappearance feeding the mountain’s hunger and the tribes’ collective faith.</p>
            <h2>The Nomads of Kaijistan</h2>
            <p>In the burning deserts of southern Kelos wander the nomads of Kaijistan, descendants of a kingdom swallowed by legend and sand. Marked by their violet eyes, they carry the memory of palaces and fountains that once gleamed beneath the stars, though all that remains now are fragments half-buried by the shifting dunes. Their ancestors’ fall is the subject of countless stories, but among them the darkest tale speaks of Velkaria, the jewel of Kaijistan, and the king who sealed its fate.</p>
            <p>It is said this long-dead ruler, in his hunger for power, struck a pact with a demon—promising service or sacrifice in exchange for prosperity. When he broke his side of the bargain, the demon’s wrath was merciless. The fertile fields that had fed the kingdom were transformed overnight into endless deserts, corn turned to sand, and the lifeblood of Kaijistan withered beneath a burning sun. The city of Velkaria fell silent, its people scattered to the winds, and from its ashes the nomads were born.</p>
            <p>For the survivors, the desert became both graveyard and teacher. They learned to read the stars as maps, to follow the hidden signs of insects and wind, and to guard with reverence the locations of underground waters. To waste water is to defy not only necessity but history itself, a sin echoing the folly of their king. Thus the Kaijistani nomads endure, shaped by loss yet defined by mastery of the wasteland—a people who carry both the shame of their past and the wisdom to survive it.</p>
