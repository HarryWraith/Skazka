        <article class="tb-panel" id="overview">
            <h2 class="tb-title">Overview</h2>

            <p>
                Humans have become inseparable from the history of Skazka, their story unfolding alongside the realm’s
                own evolution. They are now the most numerous of the surface-dwelling peoples, not defined by a single
                culture but by a vast collection of traditions and identities shaped by the landscapes they inhabit.
                Humanity’s defining trait has always been adaptability, and it is this quality that has allowed them to
                endure and flourish across the deserts, mountains, seas, and plains of Kelos. Yet, this very flexibility
                is a double-edged sword—granting them resilience but also leading them down dangerous and often divisive
                paths.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though varied in culture, humanity’s motivations often circle around survival, honor, and legacy. The <a
                    href="oldkaijistan.html">Kaijistani</a> nomads seek not wealth or conquest, but preservation of the
                sacred waters that sustain their desert lives. For the Horse Lords, freedom itself is the ultimate
                desire, pursued through mastery of the plains and resistance to permanence. The tribes of Mount Echo
                live for their god’s awakening, their faith demanding sacrifices both brutal and absolute. <a
                    href="caratania.html">Caratanians</a> pursue order and vigilance, driven by a conviction that their
                mission is divine and eternal, while their vineyards provide the prosperity needed to sustain that
                mission. The Sken, tied to the sea, desire glory and sustenance in equal measure, raiding as both
                survival tactic and cultural expression of their belief that the ocean rewards the bold. In all their
                forms, human desires balance between necessity and ambition, shaping societies that can be both deeply
                noble and terrifyingly ruthless.
            </p>
            <p>
                Among the peoples of Skazka, humans are both everywhere and nowhere fully unified. Their adaptability
                has ensured their dominance across the continent, yet it has also fractured them into countless
                societies with conflicting priorities. Some, like the <a href="caratania.html">Caratanians</a>, have
                built structured kingdoms that interact with other nations through trade, diplomacy, and military might.
                Others, such as the Horse Lords and the <a href="oldkaijistan.html">Kaijistani</a> nomads, resection
                more insular, bound to their lands and ways of life, often clashing with outsiders while occasionally
                offering knowledge and trade. The Mount Echo tribes, however, stand apart, their violent rituals and
                unyielding faith leaving little room for peaceful coexistence. Meanwhile, the Sken straddle the line
                between menace and necessity, their raids feared but their seafaring knowledge indispensable. Taken
                together, humanity’s role in society is paradoxical: they are the backbone of Skazka’s civilizations
                and, at the same time, a constant reminder of the chaos that adaptability can breed.

            <h2 class="tb-title">Physiology & Traits</h2>
            <p>Humans in Skazka don’t share one “look”—they wear their landscapes. Kaijistani nomads are marked by
                violet eyes from their lost desert kingdom; the Sken bear blue-tinted skin from a life at sea;
                Caratanians show the hardiness of mountain vintners and soldiers; the Horse Lords are lean, sun-browned
                riders of the plains; and Mount Echo tribes look weathered by fire and stone. They’re the most numerous
                surface folk, and their bodies—and customs—read like maps of deserts, mountains, coasts, and ashfields.
            </p>
            <p>Their defining trait is adaptability: the same flexibility that lets them survive, thrive, and spread
                also pulls them down dangerous, divisive paths. Across lineages, human drive bends toward survival,
                honor, and legacy, but how that manifests—guarding sacred waters, riding free across the grass sea,
                heeding a fire-god’s call, or drilling vineyards under a vigilant crown—varies wildly by homeland.
                Together they’re Skazka’s backbone and its wildcard: resilient, opportunistic, and endlessly shaped by
                the places they claim.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="tb-panel" id="culture">
            <h2 class="tb-title">Culture & Society</h2>
            <p>Humans in Skazka are culture-splinters of the lands that shaped them: structured kingdoms like Caratania
                (duty, vineyards, vigilant faith), mobile peoples like the Horse Lords and Kaijistani desert nomads
                (freedom, water-keeping, star-guided travel), sea-bound Sken (raiding, seamanship), and the hard
                mysticism of the Mount Echo tribes (volcanic rites, conquest visions). Across these lines their motives
                rhyme—survival, honor, legacy—but play out with wildly different priorities, from guarding sacred
                aquifers to patrolling borders or riding the grass seas. </p>
            <p>In wider society they’re both backbone and wildcard: the most numerous surface folk, dominant by
                adaptability yet fractured into competing polities with clashing codes and needs. Some integrate through
                trade, diplomacy, and military power (Caratania); others keep to their paths and only bargain on their
                terms (Horse Lords, Kaijistani); still others stand apart through fearful rites (Mount Echo), while the
                Sken sit between menace and necessity—feared raiders, indispensable sailors. That flexibility breeds
                resilience and invention—and the kind of internal rivalries that keep Skazka restless.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="tb-panel" id="faith">
            <h2 class="tb-title">Faith & Myth</h2>
            <p>Human faith in Skazka is a patchwork of place and memory rather than a single creed: each people ties its
                gods to the land that made them. Caratania binds piety to vigilance—monarchy and the Shield of Dawn
                frame a mission to hold back darkness as a sacred duty. Mount Echo tribes worship the slumbering Fire
                God, feeding a fierce, sacrificial cult that promises conquest when the mountain wakes. Sken religion
                rides with the sea: their Exodus from Skia still shapes a creed of storm-bold raids and hard-won
                survival. Kaijistani nomads center reverence on water and restraint, their myths warning against broken
                bargains and squandered lifeblood. </p>
            <p>Their myths are equally local and sharp-edged: Caratanians root identity in Hrothgar Bloodlance,
                vampire-slayer and ward against the night; Mount Echo tells of first humans forged by fire, bound to
                offerings and ash; the Sken remember the great crossing that seeded nations; and Kaijistan carries the
                cautionary tale of a king’s demonic pact that turned fields to desert—why water is holy and waste a sin.
                Across all lines, human religion bends toward survival, honor, and legacy, but the stories that teach
                those values are written in vineyards, volcanoes, coasts, and dunes.</p>

            <p>
                In Skazka, humanity split along the grain of the world itself: deserts, coasts, mountains, and ashfields
                carved different bodies, creeds, and crafts from a common stock. <a
                    href="oldkaijistan.html">Kaijistani</a> nomads guard water and

                <a href="caratania.html">Caratanians</a> marry vineyards, vigil, and crown; the Horse Lords live by
                saddle and sky; Mount Echo tribes
                harden under fire-gods and ash. Each lineage carries its land’s stamp—phenotype, law, and myth
                diverging—yet their shared impulses remain constant: survival first, honor kept, and a hunger to leave a
                lasting name.

            <p>
                The <a href="serydina.html">Sken</a> are the seafaring descendants of a great exodus from the western
                continent of Skia. Their
                survival upon the waves forged a people bound to the ocean, their blue-tinted skin marking them as
                children of the sea. Those who resectioned in the Serydina Isles developed into fearsome raiders,
                viewing the sea as both provider and battlefield, while their sectionland kin gave rise to many of
                Kelos’s human nations. For the island Sken, honor and survival are won through daring voyages, swift
                raids, and unshakable courage in the face of storm and steel.

            <p>
                The <a href="caratania.html">Caratanians</a> dwell in the shadow of the Blood Mountains, heirs to a
                legacy of defiance against the
                undead horrors that once threatened all of Kelos. Their society is steeped in bloodline and duty, noble
                houses tracing descent from Hrothgar Bloodlance, the legendary vampire-slayer. United under a vigilant
                monarchy and the militant <a href="shieldofdawn.html">Shield of Dawn</a>, <a
                    href="caratania.html">Caratania</a> thrives through discipline, faith, and the wealth of

                eternal mission of guarding humanity from darkness.

            <h3 class="tb-title">The tribes of Mount Echo</h3>
            <p>
                At the fiery foot of Mount Echo, the tribes live in fierce devotion to the Fire God they believe
                slumbers within the volcano. Claiming descent from Skazka’s first humans, they embrace a primal faith
                that demands sacrifice and blood. Their culture is shaped by ritual cannibalism, volcanic mysticism, and
                the belief that conquest awaits when their god awakens. Outsiders are rarely welcomed—most who trespass
                into their lands are taken as offerings, their disappearance feeding the mountain’s hunger and the
                tribes’ collective faith.

            <p>In the burning deserts of southern Kelos roam the nomads of <a href="oldkaijistan.html">Kaijistan</a>,
                violet-eyed descendants of a kingdom now half-buried by shifting dunes. They remember palaces and
