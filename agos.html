      <p>Agos, the hulking god of farming and agriculture, stands as a sentinel over the soil and its stewards. Often
        portrayed as a muscular, earth-streaked farmer wielding a broad scythe, he embodies the sweat and strength
        required to coax bounty from the land. He was especially revered by the Sken, the hardy folk who migrated from Skia to Kelos
        centuries ago, bringing with them veneration for Agos and integrating his worship deeply into their agrarian
        culture.

      <ul class="nodec">
        <li><b>Breaking the first furrow</b>: At spring’s first plowing, farmers dedicate the fresh earth, sprinkling
          seed and wine at Agos’s shrine, invoking his blessing.</li>

        <li><b>Mid-Summer Scythe Blessing</b>: Villagers ceremonially sharpen scythes and pass them near a hearth fire,
          offering tobacco or sweet grain to ensure a swift harvest.</li>

        <li><b>Harvest Feast (“Agos’ Abundance”)</b>: A communal celebration at harvest’s end with bread shaped like
          earthen mounds, singing of toil and thanks, and the first sheaf carried in procession to the temple.</li>
        <li><b>Stubble blessing</b>: After harvest, participants leap over burned stubble while singing an old chant to
          cleanse any lingering pestilence.</li>

        <li><b>Labour and strength</b>: He honors toil, diligence, perseverance; the very bones of a farmer echo his
          divine essence.</li>
        <li><b>Cycles of decay and renewal</b>: Agos embraces that every harvest is tied to death and rebirth—stubble
          fields feed renewal.</li>

            <h3>Lore</h3>
      <ul class="nodec">
        <li>Legend tells of a migration from Skia to Kelos, where floods and famine once
          struck the early Sken settlements. A humble farmer named Khelan prayed to Agos, and by sunrise, the clouds parted,
          revealing fertile land. The Sken built an altar on a grassy ridge where Khelan first sowed seed in Kelos, and
          for generations, every new settlement began with that same rite.</li>

        <li>A rich landowner, hoping to expand his domain, cursed a field, believing
          he could control Agos’s bounty with iron spikes. Crops failed, cattle sickened, and his family fell into
          despair — until a peasant girl, Marisa, removed the spikes and reburied them deep in the earth. With that act of
          humility, Agos restored the field, teaching that reverence outweighs dominion over the land’s spirit.</li>

        <li>Agos once walked as a mortal among farmers, testing their hearts. He
          lent a green-hilted scythe to three brothers, instructing them to harvest their own plots. The first two
          brothers ignored the soil’s needs and cut swiftly — the yield was poor and blighted. The youngest brother, however,
          cleaned the field, prayed for the blade’s guidance, and worked patiently. When he finished, his scythe glowed
          with verdant light and his yield overflowed. Agos revealed himself, granting the farmer lifelong
          protection—and.</li>
