    <p>Beneath the obsidian veil of eternity, an endless astral sea sprawled — a blackened abyss that swallowed all light and
        hope. It was a void eternal and unmoving, where silence rotted in the bones of time. Yet, from the crushing depths
        of that dead stillness, an ember flickered to life. The abyss flared with a blaze — flames that burned
        with a hellish coldness, both scalding and frozen.</p>
    
    <p>That cosmic fire raged, consuming the astral sea in its grasp. The fragile weave of the cosmos tore apart,
        cracking like shattered bone under an ethereal force. Splintered into countless jagged shards, the universe bled
        fragments into the dark expanse. Each shard, a realm cast into its own shadowed corner of time and
        space — birthplaces of realms both cursed and blessed, the fractured planes of existence.</p>

            <h2>In the beginning...</h2>
        <p>
          For an age, the planes roared with untamed fury — flames of creation and
          chaos alike — but eventually, the fire began to fade. From its embers
          arose stars, worlds, and places of great power. And from those places,
          the first gods emerged: the Vekya, or Primals.
        </p>

        <p>
          There were three:<br />
          Uzume, goddess of creation,<br />
          Kaos, lord of disorder,<br />
          and Kronos, keeper of cosmic time.
        </p>
        </article>

        <article class="article-small">
            <h2>Daggers in the night...</h2>
        <p>
          Uzume was alone, for both Kronos and and Kaos were relentless and unwavering 
          in their task. Lonely in her divinity, Uzume tore a piece from her own essence 
          and formed wondrous beings to accompany her and carry out her will across
          the multiverse. These were the Annarr and their companions, the
          Annarr-kin. The Annarr were gods in their own right — mighty and
          strange. The Annarr-kin, though formidable, fell short of godhood, and could, 
          perhaps, be considered to be Familiars of a sort.
        </p>

        <p>
          Seeing Uzume’s creations, Kaos and Kronos grew bitter. Jealousy
          poisoned their thoughts, and they conspired to steal her power. Yet
          some cosmic force forbade them from harming her directly. So they
          turned to the Annarr and Annarr-kin. None would join them — save one.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Great Dragon Fafnirog, devourer of light, who slumbered in the
          darkest voids, accepted their offer. In return for his betrayal, he
          would be granted the power of a god.
        </p>

        <p>
          Kaos and Kronos lured Uzume to the Celestial Forge, where the first
          spark had been born. There, hidden in shadow, Fafnirog struck. He tore
          her open and scattered her essence.

        <article class="article-small">
            <h2>Rebirth...</h2>
        <p>
          As Uzume’s divine light faded, the remaining Vekya tried to consume
          what remained—but her essence had become poison to them. In her final
          breath, Uzume cast the last of herself into the cosmos, a gift to
          all—but the Vekya.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this is why the flowers bloom and wither. <br />
          Why trees grow from seedling to ancient oak. <br />
          Why the races of Skazka can create life in each other.
        </p>

        <p>
          Uzume’s gift lives on—in all things, except the gods who betrayed her.
